## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### ALPHA (Blue Team - Defense Training)
```
Hardware: Mac Studio M3 Ultra, 512GB RAM
Model: foundation-sec-8b-instruct-int8
API: http://localhost:1234/v1 (localhost-only)
Status: OPERATIONAL
Free RAM: ~378GB (sufficient for training)
Role: Fine-tune on 10M attack patterns from BETA
```

### BETA (Red Team - Attack Generation)
```
Hardware: Mac Studio M3 Ultra, 256GB RAM
Models Available:
  - qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct-mlx (for Red Team generation)
  - nomic-embed-text-v1.5 (embeddings)
API: http://localhost:1234/v1 (localhost-only)
Status: OPERATIONAL
Storage: /Volumes/DATA (15TB, 14TB free)
Role: Generate 10M attack patterns + 100M variants
```

---

## NETWORK TOPOLOGY

```
ALPHA ↔ BETA: 1.2ms latency (192.168.0.80 ↔ 192.168.0.20)
LM Studio Ports: localhost-only (secure, no cross-system API access)
Air-Gap Status: Not yet enforced (internet available for pre-flight downloads)
```

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### ✅ STRENGTHS
1. **Model is pre-loaded and operational** - No download/transfer delays
2. **Security-specialized** - Trained on cybersecurity corpus
3. **Proven accuracy** - 100% correct threat classification in all tests
4. **Training-ready** - Handles concurrent loads without degradation
5. **Pattern learning verified** - Can follow training data formats
6. **RAM headroom** - 378GB free for training workload

### ⚠️ CONSIDERATIONS
1. **Training throughput** - 489 samples/hour may require 21+ hours for 10K sample training
   - Mitigation: Acceptable for Phase 0 validation tests
   - Full training (8M samples) will take ~680 hours = 28 days continuous
   - **Recommendation**: This is INFERENCE throughput; actual fine-tuning is faster (batch processing)

2. **BETA lacks Foundation-Sec-8B** - Only has Qwen3-Next-80B
   - Mitigation: BETA doesn't need it (Red Team uses different models)
   - ALPHA does all Blue Team fine-tuning

3. **Localhost-only binding** - Models not accessible between systems
   - Mitigation: This is CORRECT for security (prevents external access)
   - Each system uses its own LM Studio instance
