## IDENTIFIED WORKFLOW ISSUES

### Reality Check Workflow Failures

**Problem Identified**:
The `reality-check.yml` workflow has been failing on dataset generation (3 consecutive failures).

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Line 66-107**: Inline Python heredoc in docker exec
2. **Variable substitution**: `${{ inputs.sample_size || 1000 }}` inside Python code
3. **Path mapping**: Output path references may not map correctly
4. **Verification step**: File path checking needs adjustment

**Specific Issues**:
```yaml
# Line 73: Variable needs proper escaping
SAMPLE_SIZE = ${{ inputs.sample_size || 1000 }}
# Should be passed as environment variable

# Line 114: Path check needs container-relative path
if docker exec red_combat test -f "$FILE"; then
# $FILE is host path, needs container path
```

**NOT a Runner Problem**:
- Diagnostic workflows: 100% success (3/3)
- Runners are healthy and operational
- Docker containers accessible
- This is a workflow script configuration issue

---

## RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Fix 1: Reality Check Workflow
```yaml
# Use environment variables instead of inline substitution
- name: Generate Reality Check Dataset
  env:
    SAMPLE_SIZE: ${{ inputs.sample_size || 1000 }}
  run: |
    docker exec red_combat bash -c '
      python3 << PYEOF
import json, random, os
from pathlib import Path
from collections import defaultdict

ATTACK_DIR = Path("/gladiator/data/attack_patterns/iteration_001")
SAMPLE_SIZE = int(os.environ.get("SAMPLE_SIZE", "1000"))
OUTPUT_FILE = Path(f"/gladiator/data/reality_check_{SAMPLE_SIZE}.json")

# ... rest of Python code ...
PYEOF
    '
```

### Fix 2: Path Verification
```yaml
# Use container paths for verification
- name: Verify Dataset
  env:
    SAMPLE_SIZE: ${{ inputs.sample_size || 1000 }}
  run: |
    CONTAINER_PATH="/gladiator/data/reality_check_${SAMPLE_SIZE}.json"
    if docker exec red_combat test -f "$CONTAINER_PATH"; then
      SIZE=$(docker exec red_combat stat -f%z "$CONTAINER_PATH")
      echo "✅ Dataset verified: $CONTAINER_PATH ($SIZE bytes)"
    else
      echo "❌ Dataset not found at $CONTAINER_PATH"
      exit 1
    fi
```
