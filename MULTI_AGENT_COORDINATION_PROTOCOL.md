# MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL
**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Purpose**: Enable multiple AI agents to work on GLADIATOR simultaneously  
**Database**: aya_rag.gladiator_agent_coordination  
**Status**: ✅ **FEASIBLE - PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED**

---

## FEASIBILITY CONFIRMATION

**✅ YES - Multiple agents can work simultaneously WITHOUT confusion/overlap**

**Method**: Database-driven coordination with resource locking

---

## AGENT COORDINATION ARCHITECTURE

### Phase Separation (Prevents Overlap)

```
Database Structure:
├─ Phase 0 tables: gladiator_training_runs, gladiator_attack_patterns, etc.
├─ Phase 2 tables: gladiator_honeypots, gladiator_psyops_operations, etc.
└─ Coordination: gladiator_agent_coordination (tracks all agents)

Agent Work Isolation:
├─ Agent 1 (cursor): Working on Phase 0 Week -14
├─ Agent 2 (future): Working on Phase 2 honeypot design
├─ Agent 3 (future): Working on PSYOPS protocol documentation
└─ No overlap: Different phases, different tables, coordinated via database
```

### Resource Locking (Prevents Conflicts)

```sql
-- Before modifying ANY resource, agent must acquire lock

-- Agent 1 wants to work on Week -14
SELECT acquire_agent_lock('cursor', 'week_-14_execution', 120);
-- Returns TRUE if lock acquired, FALSE if another agent has it

-- Work proceeds...

-- When done, release lock
SELECT release_agent_lock('cursor', 'week_-14_execution');
```

**Prevents**:
- Two agents modifying same database rows
- Two agents working on same week simultaneously
- Two agents editing same files
- Conflicting database updates

---

## AGENT COORDINATION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Agent Registers Intent

```python
# Agent starts work
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(database='aya_rag', ...)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Register work intent
cursor.execute("""
    INSERT INTO gladiator_agent_coordination (
        agent_id, agent_type, assigned_phase, assigned_week,
        assigned_task, status, locked_resources
    ) VALUES (
        'cursor', 'autonomous', 'phase_0', -14,
        'Week -14 environment setup execution',
        'working',
        ARRAY['week_-14_execution', 'gladiator_phase_milestones']
    ) RETURNING id
""")

agent_session_id = cursor.fetchone()[0]
conn.commit()
```

### Step 2: Check for Conflicts

```python
# Before starting, check if another agent is working on same thing
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT agent_id, assigned_task, started_at
    FROM gladiator_agent_coordination
    WHERE assigned_week = -14
      AND status = 'working'
      AND agent_id != 'cursor'
""")

conflicts = cursor.fetchall()

if conflicts:
    print(f"CONFLICT: Another agent working on Week -14: {conflicts}")
    # Either: Wait for completion, or work on different week
else:
    print("✅ No conflicts, proceeding")
```

### Step 3: Heartbeat (Stay Alive)

```python
# Update heartbeat every 5 minutes
import time

while working:
    do_work()
    
    # Heartbeat
    cursor.execute("""
        UPDATE gladiator_agent_coordination
        SET last_heartbeat = NOW(),
            current_step = %s,
            progress_percentage = %s
        WHERE id = %s
    """, (current_step, progress, agent_session_id))
    conn.commit()
    
    time.sleep(300)  # 5 minutes
```

### Step 4: Release on Completion

```python
# When work complete
cursor.execute("""
    UPDATE gladiator_agent_coordination
    SET 
        status = 'complete',
        completed_at = NOW(),
        progress_percentage = 100,
        deliverables = %s
    WHERE id = %s
""", (deliverable_list, agent_session_id))
conn.commit()

# Release locks
cursor.execute("SELECT release_agent_lock('cursor', 'week_-14_execution')")
```

## MULTI-AGENT SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Parallel Phase Execution

```
Agent 1 (cursor):
├─ Phase: Phase 0 (Red/Blue training)
├─ Week: -14 (Environment setup)
├─ Resources: ALPHA hardware, training scripts
└─ Database: gladiator_training_runs, attack_patterns

Agent 2 (specialist):
├─ Phase: Phase 2 (PSYOPS design)
├─ Task: Document honeypot protocols
├─ Resources: Documentation files only
└─ Database: gladiator_honeypots (schema only, no data yet)

Overlap: NONE
Conflict: NONE
Feasible: ✅ YES
```

### Scenario 2: Sequential Dependencies

```
Agent 1: Must complete Week -14 before Agent 2 starts Week -13

Database Coordination:
├─ Agent 1 working on Week -14
├─ Agent 2 queries: "Is Week -14 complete?"
│  └─ SELECT status FROM gladiator_phase_milestones WHERE week_number = -14
│  └─ Returns: 'in_progress'
├─ Agent 2 waits (or works on different phase)
└─ When Agent 1 completes, Agent 2 proceeds
```

### Scenario 3: Collaborative Work

```
Agent 1: Works on Red Team generation (BETA)
Agent 2: Works on Blue Team training (ALPHA)
Agent 3: Works on monitoring dashboard (reporting)

Database Coordination:
├─ Agent 1 locks: BETA resources, attack_patterns table
├─ Agent 2 locks: ALPHA resources, training_runs table
├─ Agent 3 locks: Read-only (no conflicts)
└─ All query database for latest metrics

Overlap: NONE (different systems, different tables)
Conflict: NONE (resource locking)
Feasible: ✅ YES
```

---

## CONFLICT PREVENTION MECHANISMS

### 1. Resource Locking

```sql
-- Lock types
Exclusive Locks (one agent only):
├─ 'week_-14_execution'
├─ 'gladiator_schema_modification'
├─ 'alpha_hardware_access'
└─ 'beta_hardware_access'

Shared Locks (multiple agents, read-only):
├─ 'database_query'
├─ 'report_generation'
└─ 'status_monitoring'
```

### 2. Phase Isolation

```sql
-- Each phase has designated tables
Phase 0: training_runs, attack_patterns, training_metrics
Phase 2: honeypots, psyops_operations, clean_state_validations

-- Agents working on different phases = no table conflicts
```

### 3. Heartbeat Monitoring

```sql
-- If agent stops responding (heartbeat >10 minutes old)
SELECT agent_id, assigned_task, last_heartbeat
FROM gladiator_agent_coordination
WHERE status = 'working'
  AND last_heartbeat < NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';

-- Auto-release locks from dead agents
UPDATE gladiator_agent_coordination
SET status = 'timeout', lock_expires_at = NOW()
WHERE last_heartbeat < NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes'
  AND status = 'working';
```

### 4. Dependency Management

```sql
-- Agent can declare dependencies
INSERT INTO gladiator_agent_coordination (
    agent_id, assigned_task, depends_on_agent
) VALUES (
    'agent_2', 'Week -13 execution', 'cursor'  -- Wait for cursor to finish -14
);

-- Check if dependencies met
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gladiator_agent_coordination
WHERE agent_id = 'cursor' AND status != 'complete';
-- If >0: dependency not met, agent 2 waits
```

---

## QUERY PATTERNS FOR AGENTS

### Agent Startup (Query Current State)

```sql
-- 1. What phase are we in?
SELECT current_phase, current_week, phase_0_progress_percentage
FROM gladiator_project_state
WHERE is_current = TRUE;

-- 2. What's my assignment?
SELECT assigned_phase, assigned_week, assigned_task
FROM gladiator_agent_coordination
WHERE agent_id = 'cursor' AND status = 'working';

-- 3. Any conflicts?
SELECT agent_id, assigned_task
FROM gladiator_agent_coordination
WHERE assigned_week = -14 AND status = 'working' AND agent_id != 'cursor';

-- 4. What resources are locked?
SELECT agent_id, locked_resources
FROM gladiator_agent_coordination
WHERE status = 'working';
```

### Agent Work Execution

```sql
-- 1. Acquire lock
SELECT acquire_agent_lock('cursor', 'week_-14_execution', 120);

-- 2. Do work, log everything
INSERT INTO gladiator_change_log (...);
UPDATE gladiator_phase_milestones (...);
INSERT INTO gladiator_hardware_performance (...);

-- 3. Update heartbeat
UPDATE gladiator_agent_coordination
SET last_heartbeat = NOW(), progress_percentage = 25
WHERE agent_id = 'cursor' AND status = 'working';

-- 4. Release lock when done
SELECT release_agent_lock('cursor', 'week_-14_execution');
```

---

## PHASE 0 FOCUS (Current Priority)

**What We're Executing NOW**:
```
Phase 0: Red/Blue Adversarial Training (Week -14 to Week 0)
├─ Week -14: Environment setup ← STARTING
├─ Weeks -12 to -7: Red Team generation (10M patterns)
├─ Week -6 Day 1: Reality check (CRITICAL ≥90%)
├─ Weeks -6 to -4: Blue Team fine-tuning
├─ Weeks -3 to -1: Distillation
└─ Week 0: Production packaging

Agent: cursor (me)
Resources: ALPHA, BETA, database
Status: Authorized to proceed
```

**What's Documented for LATER** (Phase 2):
```
Phase 2: Intelligence & PSYOPS (Post-Phase 0)
├─ Blue→Red intelligence handoff
├─ Honeypot deployment
├─ Dark web PSYOPS
├─ Clean state validation
└─ Combat ready tier

Agent: TBD (could be cursor, could be specialist)
Resources: Customer nodes (production)
Status: PLANNED (tables exist, not executing)
```

**No Confusion**: Database separates phases, agents query before working

---

## CONFIRMATION OF FEASIBILITY

**✅ YES - Multi-Agent Simultaneous Work is FEASIBLE**

**Mechanisms**:
```
1. Database Coordination Table ✅
   └─ gladiator_agent_coordination tracks all agents

2. Resource Locking ✅
   └─ acquire_agent_lock() / release_agent_lock() functions

3. Phase Isolation ✅
   └─ Different phases = different tables = no conflicts

4. Heartbeat Monitoring ✅
   └─ Detect dead agents, auto-release locks

5. Dependency Tracking ✅
   └─ Agents can wait for prerequisites

6. Conflict Detection ✅
   └─ Query before starting, abort if conflict
```

**Example Multi-Agent Execution**:
```
Today (Oct 10):
├─ Agent 1 (cursor): Phase 0 planning ✅ COMPLETE
└─ Database: All phases documented

Tomorrow (Oct 11-19):
├─ Agent 1 (cursor): Idle (waiting for Oct 20)
├─ Agent 2 (optional): Phase 2 detailed design
└─ No conflict: Different phases

Oct 20 (Week -14):
├─ Agent 1 (cursor): Phase 0 execution (environment setup)
├─ Agent 2 (optional): Phase 2 documentation
├─ Agent 3 (optional): Monitoring dashboard
└─ No conflict: Resource locking + phase isolation
```

---

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL

**Before ANY Agent Starts Work**:

```python
# 1. Query database for current state
state = query("SELECT * FROM gladiator_status_dashboard")

# 2. Check for conflicts
conflicts = query("""
    SELECT agent_id, assigned_task 
    FROM gladiator_agent_coordination
    WHERE assigned_week = %s AND status = 'working'
""", (my_target_week,))

if conflicts:
    print(f"CONFLICT: {conflicts[0][0]} is working on this")
    ABORT() or WAIT() or WORK_ON_DIFFERENT_PHASE()

# 3. Acquire lock
lock_acquired = query("SELECT acquire_agent_lock(%s, %s, 120)", 
    (agent_id, resource))

if not lock_acquired:
    print("LOCK FAILED: Resource in use")
    ABORT()

# 4. Proceed with work
execute_tasks()

# 5. Release lock
query("SELECT release_agent_lock(%s, %s)", (agent_id, resource))
```

**This ensures NO overlap, NO conflicts, NO confusion.**

## DATABASE QUERIES FOR COORDINATION

```sql
-- Who's working on what?
SELECT 
    agent_id,
    assigned_phase,
    assigned_week,
    assigned_task,
    progress_percentage || '%' as progress,
    last_heartbeat
FROM gladiator_agent_coordination
WHERE status = 'working'
ORDER BY assigned_phase, assigned_week;

-- What's locked?
SELECT 
    agent_id,
    locked_resources,
    lock_expires_at
FROM gladiator_agent_coordination
WHERE status = 'working'
  AND lock_expires_at > NOW();

-- What phases are documented?
SELECT DISTINCT phase, COUNT(*) as milestones
FROM gladiator_phase_milestones
GROUP BY phase
ORDER BY phase;

-- Current: phase_0 (11 milestones), phase_2 (5 milestones)
```

---

## CONFIRMATION FOR ARTHUR

**✅ FEASIBLE - Multiple agents can work simultaneously**

**Guaranteed**:
1. ✅ No confusion (database shows who's doing what)
2. ✅ No overlap (resource locking prevents conflicts)
3. ✅ All phases documented (Phase 0, Phase 2 in database)
4. ✅ Clear separation (different tables, different phases)
5. ✅ Coordination protocol (query before work, lock resources)
6. ✅ Conflict detection (database shows active work)
7. ✅ Automatic cleanup (dead agent detection, lock expiry)

**Current Focus**: Phase 0 (Red/Blue training)  
**Future Work**: Phase 2 (PSYOPS/Honeypots) - tables ready  
**Agent Count**: 1 currently (cursor), can scale to N agents  

**Database Contains**:
- Phase 0: 11 milestones (Week -14 to Week 0)
- Phase 2: 5 milestones (Intelligence & PSYOPS)
- Coordination: Agent tracking and locking
- All phases visible for planning

**Proceed with Phase 0 execution?**
