## üî¥ CRITICAL: BETA DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

### Problem Identified and Documented

**BETA has TWO GLADIATOR locations**:

1. **`/Users/arthurdell/GLADIATOR/`** (GitHub repo - runner installer only)
   - Created by: rsync from ALPHA
   - Contains: `runners/` subdirectory
   - Size: ~50KB
   - Purpose: Runner installation files
   - **NOT the main project**

2. **`/Volumes/DATA/GLADIATOR/`** ‚≠ê **ACTUAL PROJECT DATA**
   - Size: 53GB
   - Contains: attack_patterns/, Qwen/, scripts/
   - Docker mount: ‚Üí `/gladiator/data` (inside red_combat)
   - **THIS IS THE REAL WORKING DIRECTORY**

### Workflow Path Reference

**CORRECT paths for BETA workflows:**
```yaml
# Generate dataset (use Docker container)
- run: |
    docker exec red_combat python3 << 'EOF'
    from pathlib import Path
    ATTACK_DIR = Path("/gladiator/data/attack_patterns/iteration_001")
    # ... paths inside container use /gladiator/data/
    EOF

# Transfer to ALPHA (use host path)
- run: |
    rsync /Volumes/DATA/GLADIATOR/reality_check_1000.json \
      alpha.local:/Users/arthurdell/GLADIATOR/datasets/
```

**WRONG paths** ‚ùå:
```bash
/Users/arthurdell/GLADIATOR/attack_patterns/  # Doesn't exist!
```

---

## Service Management

### ALPHA Commands
```bash
# Status
sudo launchctl list | grep github.actions.runner.alpha

# Restart
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.actions.runner.alpha.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.actions.runner.alpha.plist

# Logs
tail -f /Users/runner/actions-runner/runner.out.log
```

### BETA Commands
```bash
# SSH to BETA first
ssh arthurdell@beta.local

# Status
sudo launchctl list | grep github.actions.runner.beta

# Restart
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.actions.runner.beta.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.actions.runner.beta.plist

# Logs
sudo tail -f /Users/runner/actions-runner/runner.out.log
```

## Smoke Test Results

**Workflow**: Runner Smoke Test  
**Trigger**: Automatic (on workflow file push)  
**Branch**: gladiator

### ALPHA Job (Succeeded ‚úÖ)
```
Job: Diagnostics (ALPHA)
Started: 2025-10-16 17:08:39Z
Completed: 2025-10-16 17:09:20Z
Duration: 41 seconds
Result: ‚úÖ Succeeded
```

### BETA Job (Succeeded ‚úÖ)
```
Job: Diagnostics (BETA)
Started: 2025-10-16 17:17:41Z
Completed: 2025-10-16 17:18:23Z
Duration: 42 seconds
Result: ‚úÖ Succeeded
```

**Verification**: Both runners executed test jobs successfully, proving:
- ‚úÖ Runners registered correctly
- ‚úÖ Label matching works
- ‚úÖ Jobs execute on correct systems
- ‚úÖ Logs captured properly
- ‚úÖ Results reported to GitHub

---

## Next Steps

### 1. ‚úÖ Change BETA Password (Security)
```bash
ssh beta.local
passwd
# Change from "Power" to secure password
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Execute Reality Check Workflow

**GitHub UI**: https://github.com/arthurelgindell/AYA/actions

Steps:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "GLADIATOR Reality Check"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Branch: `gladiator`
5. Sample size: `1000`
6. Click "Run workflow"

### 3. Monitor Execution

**Real-time** (GitHub UI):
- https://github.com/arthurelgindell/AYA/actions

**Logs** (if needed):
```bash
# ALPHA
tail -f /Users/runner/actions-runner/runner.out.log

# BETA
ssh beta.local
sudo tail -f /Users/runner/actions-runner/runner.out.log
```

## Lessons Learned

**üî¥ CRITICAL MISTAKES IDENTIFIED**:

1. **Assumed path consistency across systems** ‚ùå
   - ALPHA: `/Users/arthurdell/GLADIATOR/` = GitHub repo
   - BETA: `/Volumes/DATA/GLADIATOR/` = Actual project
   - **FIX**: Always verify paths before commands

2. **Created confusing directory structure** ‚ùå
   - rsync'd only `runners/` to BETA
   - Created `/Users/arthurdell/GLADIATOR/` on BETA (misleading)
   - **FIX**: Documented both locations in `BETA_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`

3. **Didn't verify before claiming success** ‚ùå
   - Said "runner installed" without checking logs
   - **FIX**: Prime directive - verify with evidence

**CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN**:
- ‚úÖ Created `BETA_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` (critical reference)
- ‚úÖ Verified both runners operational with log evidence
- ‚úÖ Documented correct paths for workflows
- ‚úÖ Smoke test passed (proof of configuration)

---

## Production Readiness Checklist

- ‚úÖ ALPHA runner: Operational, tested
- ‚úÖ BETA runner: Operational, tested
- ‚úÖ Smoke test: Passed on both systems
- ‚úÖ GitHub integration: Verified
- ‚úÖ Directory structure: Documented
- ‚úÖ Logs: Captured and accessible
- ‚è≥ BETA password: MUST CHANGE (currently "Power")
- ‚è≥ Reality Check workflow: Ready to execute

---

## Summary

**RUNNERS DEPLOYED**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS  
**SMOKE TEST**: ‚úÖ PASSED (both ALPHA and BETA)  
**CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION**: ‚úÖ Created (`BETA_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`)  
**PRODUCTION READY**: ‚úÖ YES (after password change)

**Next**: Change BETA password, then execute Reality Check workflow.
