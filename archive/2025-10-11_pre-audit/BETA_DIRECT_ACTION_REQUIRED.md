# BETA - DIRECT ACTION REQUIRED (SSH Can't Pull Images)

## ISSUE
macOS keychain security prevents SSH from pulling Docker images.
Even with keychain unlocked, SSH sessions can't authenticate to Docker Hub.

## SOLUTION (At BETA physically or via Screen Share)

**On BETA directly** (not via SSH):

1. Open Terminal on BETA
2. Run: `docker pull python:3.11-slim`
3. Wait ~30 seconds for download
4. Verify: `docker images | grep python`

**Then** (back here, I can deploy via SSH):
```bash
# Image will be available, I can deploy:
docker run -d --name red_combat --memory 190g ... python:3.11-slim
```

## ALTERNATIVE: Use existing BETA containers

BETA already has Docker running. We could:
- Skip Docker on BETA entirely
- Run Red Team natively (what's working)
- Use Docker only on ALPHA for Blue Team

But this breaks symmetric architecture.

---

## CURRENT STATE

ALPHA: ✅ Blue Team deployed in Docker (operational)
BETA: ⏸️ Need image pull (requires physical/screen share access)
      ✅ Arming continues (94+ exploits, background)

**Quick physical action on BETA unlocks deployment.**
