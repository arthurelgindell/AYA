# ACTUAL CURRENT ARCHITECTURE (What's Really Running)

## REALITY CHECK

**BETA (Red Team)**:
```
✅ LM Studio: Running natively (localhost:1234)
✅ Llama-3.3-70B: Loaded in LM Studio
✅ Python script: Running natively (arm_all_1436_cves.py)
✅ Docker: Installed but NOT BEING USED
├─ No containers running
└─ Arming happening OUTSIDE Docker (native execution)

Why Native:
├─ Faster (no Docker overhead)
├─ Models already loaded in LM Studio
├─ Local execution optimal performance
└─ Works immediately (no container setup needed)
```

**ALPHA (Blue Team)**:
```
✅ LM Studio: Running natively (localhost:1234)
✅ Foundation-sec-8b: Loaded in LM Studio
✅ Docker: Running with 2 containers
├─ blue_arena: Created but EMPTY (not being used)
├─ red_arena: Created but EMPTY (not being used)
└─ Blue Team: Running OUTSIDE Docker (native)

Why Native:
├─ Model already loaded in LM Studio
├─ Immediate availability
└─ Deployed Blue Stage 2 natively (faster)
```

## DOCKER STATUS

**ALPHA Docker**:
- Containers: 2 (blue_arena, red_arena)
- Status: Running but EMPTY
- Resources: 7.65GB allocated
- Usage: 0% (containers idle)

**BETA Docker**:
- Containers: 0 (none created)
- Status: Docker running but unused
- Resources: 7.65GB allocated
- Usage: 0% (not being used)

## ACTUAL EXECUTION

**What's REALLY happening**:
```
BETA Native:
├─ Python script processing CVEs
├─ Calling LM Studio API locally
├─ Llama 70B generating exploits
├─ Saving to /Volumes/DATA/GLADIATOR/armed_exploits/
└─ Performance: 21 exploits/minute ✅

ALPHA Native:
├─ Foundation-sec-8b loaded in LM Studio
├─ Blue Team detection tested
├─ Database logging activity
└─ Cursor monitoring ✅

Docker:
├─ Created for arena concept
├─ Currently unused
└─ Can deploy to containers later if needed
```

## QUESTION FOR ARTHUR

Should we:

**A) Continue native execution** (what's working now)
   - Red Team: Keep arming natively on BETA
   - Blue Team: Deploy natively on ALPHA
   - Docker: Use later if needed for isolation testing
   - Pros: Fast, working, no reconfiguration
   - Cons: Docker subscriptions unused

**B) Move to Docker architecture**
   - Stop native arming
   - Deploy Red to BETA Docker container
   - Deploy Blue to ALPHA Docker container
   - Pros: Uses Docker subscriptions, true arena isolation
   - Cons: Requires reconfiguration, slower setup

**C) Hybrid approach**
   - Keep arming natively (finish in 1 hour)
   - THEN deploy to Docker for combat testing
   - Pros: Best of both (fast arming + Docker combat)
   - Cons: Sequential not parallel

My recommendation: **C (Hybrid)**
- Let BETA finish arming natively (1 hour, working well)
- Then move to Docker for actual combat testing
- Get value from both approaches

Your call?
