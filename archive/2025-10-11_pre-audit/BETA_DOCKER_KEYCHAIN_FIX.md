# BETA DOCKER KEYCHAIN ISSUE - QUICK FIX

## PROBLEM
Docker on BETA cannot pull images via SSH (keychain locked).

## SOLUTION (On BETA directly)

**Option 1: Pull image manually** (2 minutes):
```bash
# On BETA (at the physical system or via screen sharing):
# Open Terminal on BETA
docker pull python:3.11-slim

# This will authenticate via GUI
# Then image is available for deployment
```

**Option 2: Unlock keychain** (1 minute):
```bash
# On BETA Terminal:
security -v unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
# Enter your password when prompted

# Then Docker can pull images
```

**After either fix**:
```bash
# I can then deploy via SSH:
docker run -d --name red_combat --memory 190g ... python:3.11-slim
```

**Quick action needed on BETA to unblock deployment.**

**Either pull the image or unlock keychain, then I can deploy Red Team.**
