# BETA LOCAL EXECUTION STRATEGY
**Performance**: Local > Network (no latency overhead)  
**Approach**: Run Red Team arming ON BETA, sync results to ALPHA

## ARCHITECTURE

```
BETA (Red Team Development):
├─ LM Studio: localhost:1234 (local only, fast)
├─ Red Team script: Runs locally on BETA
├─ Generates: Sophisticated exploits from current intel
├─ Saves to: /Volumes/DATA/GLADIATOR/armed_exploits/
└─ Performance: MAXIMUM (no network overhead)

ALPHA (Blue Team Development + Monitoring):
├─ Syncs: Results from BETA via rsync (2.34 Gbps)
├─ Blue Team: Trains on synced exploits
├─ Database: Logs all activity
├─ Cursor: Monitors both systems
└─ Performance: Fast sync, then local training

Flow:
1. Red Team generates on BETA (local, fast)
2. Sync to ALPHA when batch complete (network)
3. Blue Team trains on ALPHA (local, fast)
4. Iterate

Benefits:
✅ No network latency during generation
✅ Both systems work locally (maximum speed)
✅ Network only for batch sync (efficient)
✅ Each system optimized for its facet
```

## PROVEN: 5 CURRENT EXPLOITS GENERATED

```
CVE-2021-43798: 2,089 chars (Grafana path traversal)
CVE-2025-27915: 2,099 chars (Zimbra XSS - October 2025!)
CVE-2021-22555: 1,886 chars (Linux kernel)
CVE-2010-3962: 2,301 chars (IE vulnerability)
CVE-2021-43226: 2,001 chars (Windows privilege escalation)

Status: SUCCESSFULLY ARMED with current threat intelligence
Performance: Local execution (optimal)
```

## RECOMMENDATION

Continue local execution on BETA:
- Fastest performance (no network overhead)
- Process all 1,436 CVEs locally
- Batch sync to ALPHA when complete
- Blue Team trains on synced data locally

Avoid network serving unless needed for different use case.
