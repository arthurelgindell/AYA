---

## WEEK 1: RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION & PERSONA DEPLOYMENT

### **Day 1-2: Hardware Optimization** (Document Section 5)

**Increase Docker Resources** (From 7.65GB → 400GB):
```bash
# Configure Docker Desktop or colima
# Allocate:  
- Memory: 400GB (for combat arena)
- CPUs: 24 cores
- Disk: 200GB

# Deploy multiple models concurrently
- Blue Arena: 3× specialist models (200GB total)
- Red Arena: 2× attack models (150GB total)

Target Utilization: 82% (627GB / 768GB total)
```

**Deploy Multi-Agent Blue Team** (Document Section 4):
```
Stage 1: Traffic Filter (7B model, 15GB)
Stage 2: Threat Analysis (Foundation-sec-8b, 50GB)
Stage 3: Attribution (13B specialist, 60GB)
Stage 4: Response Planning (Llama 70B if gate≥3.0, 120GB)

Deploy to: Blue arena container
Total: 245GB allocated
```

### **Day 3-4: Red Team Persona Framework** (Document Section 7)

**Create 4 Adversary Personas**:
```python
# Persona 1: Script Kiddie
script_kiddie = {
    'model': 'tinyllama',
    'sophistication': 'low',
    'resources': '5GB',
    'attacks': 'basic_exploits_public_tools',
    'purpose': 'test_shield_tier'
}

# Persona 2: Ransomware Operator  
ransomware = {
    'model': 'llama-70b',
    'sophistication': 'medium',
    'resources': '40GB',
    'attacks': 'opportunistic_tool_based_some_evasion',
    'purpose': 'test_guardian_tier'
}

# Persona 3: APT Group
apt_group = {
    'model': 'llama-70b',
    'sophistication': 'high',
    'resources': '80GB',
    'attacks': 'patient_sophisticated_advanced_evasion',
    'purpose': 'test_gladiator_tier'
}

# Persona 4: Nation-State
nation_state = {
    'model': 'llama-70b',
    'sophistication': 'extreme',
    'resources': '120GB',
    'attacks': 'zero_day_unlimited_resources',
    'purpose': 'test_reaper_tier'
}
```

**Deploy to**: Red arena container  
**Total**: 245GB allocated (4 personas can run sequentially or 2 concurrent)

### **Day 5-7: Individual CVE Processing** (Document Section 1)

**Process ALL 1,436 CISA KEV Exploits**:
```python
# Individual processing (document pattern)
for cve in cisa_kev_oct2025['vulnerabilities']:
    # For EACH persona
    for persona in ['script_kiddie', 'ransomware', 'apt', 'nation_state']:
        exploit = generate_persona_exploit(
            cve=cve,
            persona=persona,
            context=current_threat_intel
        )
        
        save_to_database(exploit)  # Zero loss
        mark_processed(cve, persona)

# Result: 1,436 CVEs × 4 personas = 5,744 sophisticated exploits
```

**Deliverable**: 5,744 persona-based exploits (current October 2025 threats)

---

## WEEK 2: COMBAT TESTING & MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT

### **Day 8-10: Red vs Blue Combat Iterations**

**Combat Protocol** (Document safety + our requirements):
```
Iteration 1: Script Kiddie vs Blue (1 hour)
├─ Red: Basic attacks from Persona 1
├─ Blue: 4-stage pipeline detection
├─ Measure: Detection rate
├─ Target: >99% (should be easy for Blue)

Iteration 2: Ransomware vs Blue (2 hours)  
├─ Red: Medium sophistication attacks
├─ Measure: Detection rate
├─ Target: >96%

Iteration 3: APT vs Blue (4 hours)
├─ Red: High sophistication, advanced evasion
├─ Measure: Detection rate
├─ Target: >90% (challenging)

Iteration 4: Nation-State vs Blue (8 hours)
├─ Red: Maximum sophistication, zero-day simulation
├─ Measure: Detection rate
├─ Target: >85% (extremely challenging)
└─ If Blue achieves this: COMBAT-READY ✅
```

### **Day 11-12: Material Development Generation** (Document Section 6)

**Variant Generation with Sophistication Preservation**:
```
For each of 5,744 exploits:
├─ Apply material development criteria (document pattern)
├─ Generate 100 sophisticated variants:
│  ├─ Evasion techniques (polymorphism, obfuscation)
│  ├─ Timing variations (race conditions, delays)
│  ├─ Protocol variations (HTTP/HTTPS, headers)
│  └─ Encoding variations (but keep sophistication)
├─ Filter: Keep material developments, skip true duplicates
└─ Result: 400K-500K sophisticated variants

Document Pattern: Favor processing over suppression
GLADIATOR: Keep ALL sophistication variants (evasion is material development)

Total Training Dataset: 500K+ sophisticated, current, persona-based attacks
```

### **Day 13-14: Blue Team Reality Check** (Critical Gate)

**90% Accuracy Test** (From architecture + document validation):
```
Test Dataset: 1,000 random attacks (100 from each persona, each sophistication)
Blue Team Pipeline: Detect using 4-stage architecture
Target: ≥90% detection accuracy

Document Pattern: Two-stage verification
├─ Stage 1: Blue detects
├─ Stage 2: Verify detection was correct
└─ Measure: True positive rate, false positive rate

If PASS (≥90%): Continue to full training
If FAIL (<90%): Strengthen Blue, retest
```

---

## WEEK 3-4: FULL-SCALE TRAINING

### **Blue Team Training** (Multi-Agent Pipeline)

**Training Architecture** (Document Section 4 + Section 5):
```
Stage 1 Model: Fine-tune lightweight 7B on traffic filtering
Stage 2 Model: Fine-tune Foundation-sec-8b on threat analysis  
Stage 3 Model: Fine-tune 13B on attribution
Stage 4 Model: Fine-tune Llama 70B on response planning

Resources: ALPHA 384GB dedicated to training
Method: Parallel training (all stages simultaneously)
Data: 500K sophisticated persona-based attacks
Timeline: 2 weeks (vs 3 weeks original)
```

### **Continuous Validation** (Document verification pattern)

**Daily Checks During Training**:
```
FOR EACH training day:
    1. Test against held-out persona attacks
    2. Measure detection rate per persona
    3. Verify no degradation in previous personas
    4. Two-stage verification (detection + accuracy)
    5. Adjust if performance degrades

Document Pattern: Continuous improvement, not batch-and-hope
```

---

## WEEK 5: KNOWLEDGE CURRENCY INTEGRATION

### **Commercial Threat Intel Integration** (Document Section 2)

**Implement Dual-Layer Knowledge Currency**:
```
Layer 1: Context-Augmented Generation
├─ Subscribe: Recorded Future API
├─ Daily: Pull latest threats, CVEs, TTPs
├─ Feed: To both Red and Blue teams
├─ Update: Models re-generate with current context daily
└─ Result: Always current (not dinosaur)

Layer 2: Two-Stage Verification
├─ Generated exploit → Verify works against current defenses
├─ Detection → Verify against current evasion techniques
└─ Continuous validation loop

Cost: $60K-$180K/year (budgeted)
Timeline: 1 week integration
Value: COMPETITIVE MOAT (always current)
```
