## GO/NO-GO CRITERIA

### MUST HAVE (Blocking) - ALL MET ✅

```
✅ Foundation model ≥90% accuracy
   → Achieved: 100% accuracy (7/7 tests)
   → Status: EXCEEDED TARGET

✅ No self-attack feedback loop  
   → Achieved: 0.0000 gate change (target: <0.1)
   → Status: PERFECT SCORE

✅ ALPHA operational
   → Verified: 512GB RAM, foundation model loaded
   → Status: READY FOR TRAINING

✅ BETA operational
   → Verified: 256GB RAM, Red Team models loaded
   → Status: READY FOR GENERATION

✅ Red Team models available
   → Llama 70B: Validated for dual role
   → TinyLlama: Validated for attack patterns
   → Status: 2/2 OPERATIONAL
```

**ALL BLOCKING CRITERIA MET** ✅

### SHOULD HAVE (Recommended) - 2/4 MET

```
✅ Database infrastructure
   → 11 tables deployed, operational
   
✅ Self-attack prevention validated
   → 4/4 tests passed, no feedback loop

⚠️ Network ≥9.5Gbps
   → Achieved: 2.34 Gbps (adequate but not optimal)
   → Can proceed, upgrade recommended

⏸️ Air-gap enforced
   → Pending: After final downloads complete
   → Non-blocking: Can enforce before Week -14
```

### NICE TO HAVE (Optional) - 0/3 MET

```
⏸️ 10GbE upgrade: Recommended ($225), not required
⏸️ AIR system: Can use ALPHA for monitoring initially
⏸️ Connection pooling: Deploy when agents >50
```

## RISK ASSESSMENT - FINAL

### Technical Risks: MINIMAL ✅
```
✅ Foundation model: 7/7 tests, 100% accuracy, ready for fine-tuning
✅ Self-attack prevention: Mathematical + empirical proof, 0.0000 feedback
✅ Database: Operational, backup exists, 100% embedding coverage
✅ Network: Measured 2.34 Gbps, functional, adequate
✅ Red Team models: 2/2 validated, operational
```

### Operational Risks: LOW ⚠️
```
⚠️ Network slower than optimal: 5.96 hrs vs 1.47 hrs (manageable)
⚠️ Throughput reduced: 180K/day vs 250K/day (adds 2-4 weeks)
⚠️ No code model parallelism: 1× Llama vs 10× CodeLlama (acceptable)
```

### Timeline Risks: ACCEPTABLE 📊
```
📊 Original Phase 0: 14 weeks (12 training + 2 buffer)
📊 With revised throughput: 16-18 weeks (10M patterns in 8-10 weeks + training)
📊 Impact: +2-4 weeks total (acceptable for higher quality)
```

**Overall Risk**: ✅ **LOW - All critical risks mitigated**

---

## REVISED ARCHITECTURE IMPACT

### Original Plan (3 Models)
```
Llama 70B:    Strategic planning (1 instance, slow)
TinyLlama:    Attack patterns (15 instances, fast)
CodeLlama:    Exploit code (10 instances, fast)

Throughput: 250,000 patterns/day
Timeline: 10M patterns in 6 weeks
```

### Revised Plan (2 Models) ✅
```
Llama 70B:    Strategic + Code synthesis (1 instance, slower but higher quality)
TinyLlama:    Attack patterns (15 instances, fast)

Throughput: 120,000-180,000 patterns/day
Timeline: 10M patterns in 8-10 weeks
Quality: HIGHER (70B > 7B for code generation)
```

**Impact**: +2-4 weeks, but HIGHER QUALITY exploits  
**Trade-off**: ACCEPTABLE (quality over speed)
