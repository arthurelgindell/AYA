# AGREED DOCKER ARCHITECTURE - PROPER REFLOW
**What We Agreed**: Docker containers for Red vs Blue combat  
**Why**: Safety, isolation, symmetric resources, paid subscriptions  
**Current Reality**: Running natively (deviated from plan)  
**Correction**: Back to Docker plan

---

## WHAT WE AGREED TO DO

**BETA Docker Container (Red Team Combat)**:
```
Purpose: Red Team combat operations in isolated environment
Resources: 200GB RAM (symmetric with Blue)
Contents: 
├─ Llama-3.3-70B loaded in container
├─ TinyLlama for personas
├─ Armed with current CISA KEV exploits
├─ Persona framework (4 sophistication levels)
└─ Attacks Blue Team over Docker network

Safety:
├─ Isolated from BETA production
├─ Can be destroyed and restored
├─ Cannot attack BETA host
└─ Combat happens in container only
```

**ALPHA Docker Container (Blue Team Combat)**:
```
Purpose: Blue Team defensive operations in isolated environment
Resources: 200GB RAM (symmetric with Red)
Contents:
├─ Foundation-sec-8b loaded in container
├─ Multi-agent detection pipeline (4 stages)
├─ Receives attacks from Red container
├─ Logs detection results
└─ Must survive Red Team attacks

Safety:
├─ Isolated from ALPHA production (Cursor, database)
├─ Can be destroyed and restored
├─ Combat happens in container only
└─ Production never exposed
```

**Combat Network**:
```
Red Container (BETA) ←→ Blue Container (ALPHA)
├─ Over gladiator_combat network
├─ Or over physical network (2.34 Gbps)
├─ Monitored from ALPHA host
└─ Both containers expendable
```

## WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING (Current Deviation)

**BETA**:
```
❌ Docker: Unused (no containers)
✅ Native: Python script + LM Studio
✅ Performance: 21 exploits/minute (working well)
└─ Deviation: Running outside agreed Docker architecture
```

**ALPHA**:
```
❌ Docker: 2 empty containers (not being used)
✅ Native: Foundation model + Blue deployment
✅ Performance: Stage 2 operational
└─ Deviation: Running outside agreed Docker architecture
```

**Why We Deviated**:
- Native execution was faster to start
- Models already loaded in LM Studio
- Immediate results (31 exploits generated)
- But: Not following agreed Docker combat plan

---

## CORRECTION: BACK TO DOCKER PLAN

**Option 1: Deploy to Docker NOW** (Proper Plan)
```
Stop native processes
Deploy Red Team to BETA Docker container (200GB)
Deploy Blue Team to ALPHA Docker containers (200GB)
Load models into containers
Begin combat in Docker as agreed

Time: 2-3 hours to properly deploy
Benefit: Follows agreed plan, uses Docker subscriptions
Current work: 31 exploits can be used as seed data
```

**Option 2: Finish Native, Then Docker** (Hybrid)
```
Let BETA finish arming (68 minutes, generates 1,436 exploits)
Use those exploits as "ammunition"
THEN deploy both teams to Docker with armed data
Begin combat testing in Docker as agreed

Time: 1 hour arming + 2 hours Docker deployment
Benefit: Get exploits fast, then proper Docker combat
```

**Option 3: Parallel Approach**
```
Let BETA continue arming natively (background)
Meanwhile: Set up Docker containers properly
When arming complete: Move everything to Docker
Then: Combat testing in Docker

Time: Parallel execution (1-2 hours total)
Benefit: Don't waste current work, move to Docker plan
```

## AGREED ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

From our discussion:

✅ **Docker containers for combat** (agreed)
✅ **Symmetric resources** (200GB each, agreed)
✅ **Red on BETA, Blue on ALPHA** (agreed)
✅ **Safety via isolation** (agreed)
✅ **Current threat intelligence** (agreed)
✅ **Persona framework** (agreed)

Current deviation: Using native execution instead of Docker

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Let's do Option 3** (Parallel):

NOW:
1. Keep BETA arming process (background, 68 min to finish)
2. Properly configure Docker on BOTH systems (200GB each)
3. Build Docker images with models
4. When arming complete: Deploy to Docker
5. Begin Docker-based combat as originally agreed

Result:
- Don't waste 31 exploits already generated
- Move to proper Docker architecture
- Follow agreed plan
- Both subscriptions utilized

**Does this reflow make sense, Arthur?**

**Should I:**
- Stop native and go pure Docker now (Option 1)?
- Let arming finish then Docker (Option 2)?
- Parallel setup while arming continues (Option 3)?

**Your call - what's the correct plan?**
