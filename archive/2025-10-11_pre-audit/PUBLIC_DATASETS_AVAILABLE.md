## RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD PRIORITY

**For GLADIATOR Blue Team Training:**

### **Priority 1: MITRE ATT&CK** (Essential, 50MB)
```bash
# Download NOW - small, essential
wget https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-stix-data/raw/master/enterprise-attack/enterprise-attack.json
# ~10 minutes to download
# Provides: TTP taxonomy, behavioral patterns
```

### **Priority 2: CICIDS2017** (High value, 8GB)
```bash
# Real network attacks, labeled
# Download: 1-2 hours on fast connection
# Provides: 2.8M real attack samples
```

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

**Tonight (While you're awake)**:

```bash
# 1. Download MITRE ATT&CK (10 minutes, 50MB)
cd /Users/arthurdell/GLADIATOR/datasets/public
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitre-attack/attack-stix-data/master/enterprise-attack/enterprise-attack.json

# 2. Process into training format (5 minutes)
python3 scripts/process_mitre_data.py

# 3. Combine with our 10M synthetic
# Total: 10M synthetic + MITRE techniques = enhanced dataset

# 4. Start Blue Team training on combined dataset
# Use foundation-sec-8b on ALPHA
# ALPHA GPUs: FINALLY WORKING
```

## ENHANCED TRAINING STRATEGY

**Combine All Sources**:
```
Layer 1: Our 10M Synthetic Mutations (quantity, coverage)
Layer 2: MITRE ATT&CK (behavioral patterns, TTP taxonomy)
Layer 3: CICIDS2017 (real network traffic, 2.8M samples)
Layer 4: Exploit-DB (real exploit code, 50K samples)

Total: ~13M training samples
Quality: Synthetic + Real-world + Authoritative
Result: Foundation model understands:
  ├─ Theoretical attacks (our synthetic)
  ├─ Real-world attacks (CICIDS, UNSW)
  ├─ Behavioral patterns (MITRE)
  └─ Actual exploits (Exploit-DB)
```

**This is COMPREHENSIVE training data.**

## ARTHUR - CONFIRM APPROACH

**Download public datasets NOW?**

**Quick (10 min)**: MITRE ATT&CK only (essential, small)  
**Medium (1 hour)**: MITRE + Exploit-DB (500MB)  
**Full (2 hours)**: MITRE + CICIDS + Exploit-DB (9GB)

**Then**: Combine with our 10M + Start Blue Team training

**Type:**
- **"MITRE"** - Download just ATT&CK now (10 min)
- **"FULL"** - Download all datasets (2 hours overnight)
- **"SKIP"** - Use our 10M synthetic only, start training now

**Your call, Arthur. What's the move?**
