# RED TEAM ARMING - LIVE STATUS
**Started**: October 11, 2025  
**Process**: Running on BETA (background)  
**Target**: 1,436 current October 2025 exploits  
**Status**: ðŸš€ **IN PROGRESS**

## CURRENT PROGRESS

```
Exploits Generated: 6/1,436 (0.4%)
Source: CISA KEV (actively exploited vulnerabilities)
Model: Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (BETA)
Performance: Local execution (optimal)
Output: /Volumes/DATA/GLADIATOR/armed_exploits/
```

## WHAT'S HAPPENING

Red Team is being armed with CURRENT threat intelligence:
- Processing each CVE individually (document pattern - zero loss)
- Generating sophisticated exploits with evasion techniques
- October 2025 actively exploited vulnerabilities (not dinosaur data)
- Running locally on BETA (maximum performance)

## ESTIMATED COMPLETION

```
Current Rate: ~1-2 exploits/minute (Llama 70B inference time)
Remaining: 1,430 exploits
ETA: 12-24 hours for complete dataset

Can run overnight, review tomorrow morning.
```

## VALUE

This is INDUSTRY-LEADING training data:
âœ… Current (October 2025, not 2024)
âœ… Actively exploited (CISA confirmed)
âœ… Sophisticated (LLM-generated with evasion)
âœ… Comprehensive (all 1,436 current threats)

Competitors: Training on Kaggle 2024 datasets (dinosaurs)
GLADIATOR: Training on October 2025 active threats (current)

This is the competitive moat.
