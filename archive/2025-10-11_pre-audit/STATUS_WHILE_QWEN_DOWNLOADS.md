## FINAL DECISION PENDING

**Arthur, when Qwen download completes:**
1. Test the model (I'll provide script)
2. Verify code generation works
3. Make final Go/No-Go decision

**If Qwen works**: ✅ GO FOR PHASE 0  
**If Qwen fails**: Use Llama 70B dual-role (already validated)

**Either way**: Ready to proceed.
