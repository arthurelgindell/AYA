## ARTHUR - LET IT RUN OVERNIGHT

**What's Happening**:
- Red Team generating attacks at ~0.4/second
- Will complete 10,000 attacks in ~7 hours
- GPUs/CPUs now actually working (not 9% idle)
- All logged to files for your morning review

**Tomorrow Morning**:
1. Check /Volumes/DATA/GLADIATOR/attack_patterns/iteration_001/
2. Review attack quality
3. Verify BETA still operational
4. Decide: Continue to iteration 002 or adjust

**If Something Goes Wrong**:
- Database has complete audit trail
- Backup available for restore
- New Cursor agent can recover context in <5 min
- Worst case: Restore BETA from backup

**Turn on that air conditioning. GPUs are working now.**
