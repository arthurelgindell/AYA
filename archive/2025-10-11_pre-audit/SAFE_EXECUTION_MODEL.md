# SAFE EXECUTION MODEL - Red Team Containment
**Critical Finding**: BETA can currently reach ALPHA (SSH, PostgreSQL accessible)  
**Risk**: Red Team could attack Cursor, database, monitoring  
**Solution**: ITERATIVE AIR-GAP with your original intuition

---

## ARTHUR - YOU WERE RIGHT

**Your concern**: "Red team will consider Cursor as a target"

**Reality**: BETA can currently SSH to ALPHA and access PostgreSQL

**This means**: Sophisticated Red Team COULD attack Cursor/database

**Your original intuition** (iterative air-gap) **was CORRECT.**

## SAFE EXECUTION MODEL

### ITERATION PROTOCOL (Safe from Red Team)

```
BEFORE Iteration N:
├─ 1. Backup ALPHA + BETA (ALPHA internal - 30 sec)
├─ 2. Arthur approves (you type GO)
├─ 3. Disconnect BETA from network (physical or via networksetup)
├─ 4. BETA is AIR-GAPPED (Red Team cannot reach ALPHA/internet)
├─ 5. Start Red Team generation on BETA (local only)
└─ 6. Monitoring: Manual check via physical access or wait

DURING Iteration N (1-2 hours):
├─ Red Team generates attacks (Llama 70B + TinyLlama)
├─ Saved to /Volumes/DATA/GLADIATOR/attack_patterns/
├─ No network access (cannot attack ALPHA)
├─ No monitoring (BETA isolated)
└─ Duration: 1-2 hours, then stop

AFTER Iteration N:
├─ 1. Reconnect BETA to network
├─ 2. Check BETA health (SSH from ALPHA)
├─ 3. Cursor reviews results:
│     - How many attacks generated?
│     - BETA still operational?
│     - Any corruption detected?
├─ 4. Database: Log results
├─ 5. Arthur decision: CONTINUE or RESTORE
└─ 6. If continue: Next iteration, if restore: Load backup

SAFETY:
├─ Red Team cannot reach ALPHA (air-gapped)
├─ Red Team cannot reach internet (air-gapped)
├─ Red Team cannot attack Cursor (no network)
├─ Red Team cannot corrupt database (no access)
└─ Worst case: Red Team fills BETA disk → Restore from backup
```

## SIMPLE AIR-GAP COMMANDS

**Disconnect BETA** (Before Iteration):
```bash
# Disable BETA network (air-gap)
ssh beta.local "sudo ifconfig en0 down"

# Verify BETA isolated
ping -c 2 beta.local  # Should fail

# BETA now air-gapped, cannot reach ALPHA or internet
```

**Reconnect BETA** (After Iteration):
```bash
# Re-enable network (from ALPHA via Tailscale if needed, or physical access)
ssh beta.local "sudo ifconfig en0 up"  # Might not work if already disconnected

# Or: Physical access to BETA, run:
# sudo ifconfig en0 up

# Verify BETA reconnected
ping -c 2 beta.local  # Should work
```

---

## ALTERNATIVE: SIMPLER TRAINING MODE

**Just generate attacks locally on BETA, no network involved:**

```python
# Red Team script on BETA (no network access needed)
# Generates attacks, saves to /Volumes/DATA/GLADIATOR/
# Uses local LM Studio models only
# No SSH, no database, no ALPHA access

# After iteration: You review via SSH from ALPHA
```

**Safest approach**: Red Team never has network access during generation

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**OPTION A (SAFEST)**:
```
Iteration Protocol:
1. Backup (ALPHA internal)
2. Disconnect BETA network (ifconfig down)
3. Start Red Team script on BETA (via pre-deployed script)
4. Wait 1-2 hours (no monitoring during, BETA isolated)
5. Reconnect BETA (ifconfig up or physical access)
6. Review results via Cursor
7. Arthur decides: Continue or restore
```

**Pros**: Red Team cannot possibly attack ALPHA (no network)  
**Cons**: No real-time monitoring during iteration (blind for 1-2 hours)

**OPTION B (MONITORED)**:
```
Keep network up, rely on:
1. Red Team running in limited user account (no sudo)
2. Monitoring detects unusual activity
3. Kill switch if attacks ALPHA
4. Hope Red Team doesn't get sophisticated enough
```

**Pros**: Real-time monitoring  
**Cons**: Red Team could potentially attack monitoring

## ARTHUR'S DECISION REQUIRED

**Which model do you prefer?**

**SAFE (Option A)**:
- Disconnect BETA during iterations
- No monitoring during (blind for 1-2 hours)
- Review after each iteration
- Zero risk of Red Team attacking Cursor

**MONITORED (Option B)**:
- Keep network up
- Monitor in real-time
- Can abort if dangerous
- Small risk Red Team could attack monitoring

**I recommend OPTION A** (your original intuition was correct)

**Type:**
- **"A"** for safe iterative air-gap
- **"B"** for monitored execution with risk

**Standing by, Arthur.**
