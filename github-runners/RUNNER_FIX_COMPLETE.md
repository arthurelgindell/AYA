# GitHub Actions Runner Fix - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 22, 2025, 22:25 PST  
**Issue**: Workflow failure notifications for `test-runner-functionality.yml`  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED - Ready to install services**

---

## PROBLEM SUMMARY

**What you saw**: GitHub notification showing workflow failure (0s duration)

**Root cause**: 
- Workflow was manually triggered
- Runners were not available at that moment (not installed as services)
- GitHub immediately failed the job (no runner to pick it up)

---

## CURRENT STATUS ✅

Both runners are **OPERATIONAL** but not installed as services:

**ALPHA** (`alpha-m3-ultra`):
- Process: Running (PID 63488)
- Labels: `self-hosted,macOS,arm64,alpha,studio` ✅
- Configuration: Correct
- Service: Not installed (requires manual restart after reboot)

**BETA** (`beta-m3-ultra`):
- Process: Running (PID 86461)
- Labels: `self-hosted,macOS,arm64,beta,studio` ✅
- Configuration: Correct
- Service: Not installed (requires manual restart after reboot)

---

## SOLUTION PROVIDED ✅

### Files Created:

1. **`check_runner_status.sh`** - Monitor script
   - Checks both ALPHA and BETA runners
   - Displays status, labels, and configuration
   - Tests network connectivity
   - Usage: `./github-runners/check_runner_status.sh`

2. **`install_runner_services.sh`** - Service installer
   - Installs both runners as LaunchDaemons
   - Ensures auto-start and auto-restart
   - Usage: `sudo ./github-runners/install_runner_services.sh`

3. **`RUNNER_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Complete guide
   - Detailed troubleshooting
   - Manual installation steps
   - Verification procedures
   - Alternative solutions

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTION

### Install Runners as Services (One Command):

```bash
cd /Users/arthurdell/AYA/github-runners
sudo ./install_runner_services.sh
```

**This will**:
- Install ALPHA runner as LaunchDaemon
- Install BETA runner as LaunchDaemon (via SSH)
- Verify both services are running
- Configure auto-start on boot
- Configure auto-restart on crash

**After installation**:
- Runners will always be available
- Workflows won't fail due to "no runner"
- No manual intervention needed after reboot

---

## VERIFICATION

### 1. Check Status Before Installation:
```bash
./github-runners/check_runner_status.sh
```

**Expected**: Shows runners running but services not installed

### 2. Install Services:
```bash
sudo ./github-runners/install_runner_services.sh
```

**Expected**: Both runners installed as LaunchDaemons

### 3. Check Status After Installation:
```bash
./github-runners/check_runner_status.sh
```

**Expected**: Shows runners running AND services installed

### 4. Test Workflow:
1. Go to: https://github.com/arthurelgindell/AYA/actions
2. Click "Test Runner Functionality"
3. Click "Run workflow" → Select "main" → Run
4. All jobs should pass (green checkmarks)

---

## WHAT THIS FIXES

✅ **No more workflow failures** due to runners being unavailable  
✅ **Auto-start on boot** - Runners start automatically after system restart  
✅ **Auto-restart on crash** - If runner process crashes, it restarts automatically  
✅ **Always available** - Workflows can run anytime without manual intervention  
✅ **Survives reboots** - No need to manually restart runners after system updates  

---

## ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS

If you don't want to install services:

### Option A: Keep Current State (Manual)
- Runners work now
- Just remember to restart after reboot
- Check status: `./github-runners/check_runner_status.sh`

### Option B: Disable Workflow (Stop Notifications)
```bash
cd /Users/arthurdell/AYA
git rm .github/workflows/test-runner-functionality.yml
git commit -m "Disable test-runner-functionality workflow"
git push origin main
```

---

## MONITORING

### Check runner status anytime:
```bash
/Users/arthurdell/AYA/github-runners/check_runner_status.sh
```

### Restart services if needed:
```bash
# ALPHA
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/actions.runner.arthurelgindell-AYA.alpha-m3-ultra

# BETA
ssh beta.local "sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/actions.runner.arthurelgindell-AYA.beta-m3-ultra"
```

- Runners: https://github.com/arthurelgindell/AYA/settings/actions/runners
