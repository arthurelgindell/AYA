- **Validation Samples**: 171 (71 attacks + 100 benign)
- **Training Duration**: ~11 minutes (100 iterations)
- **Validation Duration**: 101.2 seconds

### Training Performance
```

## LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well

1. **Balanced Dataset**: 50/50 attack/benign ratio crucial for binary classification
2. **Chat Template**: Using `apply_chat_template()` eliminated empty responses
3. **Dual-Track Approach**: Binary + multi-class provides comprehensive validation
4. **Fresh Models**: Training separate models for each task improved specialization
5. **Quality Over Speed**: Taking time to properly prepare data paid off

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Privilege Escalation**: Only 62.5% accuracy - needs more training samples
2. **Dataset Size**: 900 samples is minimum - 10K will be better for production
3. **Category Balance**: Some categories underrepresented in current dataset
4. **Unknown Labels**: Still 18-20% unknown - need better labeling

### Recommendations for Full Training

1. **Expand Dataset**: Minimum 10,000 samples before Blue Team training
2. **Balance Categories**: Ensure each attack type has ≥500 samples
3. **Improve Labeling**: Reduce "unknown" labels to <10%
4. **Focus on Weak Areas**: Prioritize privilege escalation in expansion
5. **Maintain Quality**: Manual review + automated validation for all new samples
