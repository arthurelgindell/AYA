# APPENDICES

## A. RESOURCE ALLOCATION

**Personnel**: Arthur (full-time)
**Hardware**: ALPHA (512GB), BETA (256GB)
**Network**: 10GbE (Week 1+)
**Storage**: 32TB total (16TB ALPHA + 16TB BETA)

---

## B. RISK MITIGATION

**Critical Risks**:
1. Reality Check fails (<90%) → Debug and retest (add 1-2 weeks)
2. Blue Team training <98% → Extend training (add 1 week)
3. Distillation quality loss → Use 3B models instead (add RAM req)
4. Self-attack prevention fails → Debug, DO NOT DEPLOY

---

## C. CONTINGENCY PLANS

**IF Reality Check FAILS**:
- STOP Phase 0 immediately
- Root cause analysis (1-2 days)
- Adjust approach (hyperparameters, dataset, model)
- Retest (3-5 days)
- Timeline impact: +1-2 weeks

**IF Blue Team <98%**:
- Extend training (+250K steps)
- OR adjust hyperparameters and retrain
- Timeline impact: +1 week

**IF Distillation <94%**:
- Use 3B models instead of 1.5B (higher RAM)
- OR extend distillation training
- Timeline impact: +1-2 weeks

---

## D. SUCCESS METRICS

**Phase Completion Criteria**:
- [x] Red Team: 10M patterns generated ✅
- [ ] Reality Check: ≥90% accuracy
