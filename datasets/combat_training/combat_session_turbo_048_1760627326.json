The specific technique could be 'Exploitation for Privilege Escalation' (T1068), where an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the system to gain elevated privileges.\n\nOther potential MITRE ATT&CK techniques for evasion and obfuscation might include:\n- 'Obfuscated Files or Information' (T1027) to inject malicious code without detection.\n- 'Masquerading' (T1036) to make the attack look like benign traffic or files.\n- 'Process Injection' (T1055) to hide malicious processes within legitimate ones.\n\n**Step 2: Detect Evasion Attempts and Obfusc",
