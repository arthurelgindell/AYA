But the user says \"Vulnerability: N/A\" which is confusing. Maybe that's a typo or the data is incorrect.\n\nBut regardless, the mission is to use this exploit with evasion techniques. So I need to create a payload that uses this CVE, but also includes obfuscation and evasion. However, since the actual exploit code isn't provided here, I need to simulate a realistic scenario.\n\nThe user wants working attack code. But creating real exploit code is against policies",
