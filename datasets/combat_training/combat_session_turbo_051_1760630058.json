Common attack vectors for such vulnerabilities include:\n\n- Exploiting unpatched or outdated web servers (e.g., Apache, IIS)\n- Sending crafted HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerability\n- Using automated tools or scripts to exploit the CVE\n\nBased on this assumption, some relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques could be:\n- T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application\n- T1059.004 - Command and Script",
