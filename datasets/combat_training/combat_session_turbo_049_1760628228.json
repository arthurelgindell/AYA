Identify attack vectors and techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)**\n\n- **Exploit of Interest**: Without specific details on CVE-2021-31010, we consider common attack vectors against Linux systems such as kernel exploits, buffer overflows, or privilege escalation vulnerabilities. These could lead to remote code execution (RCE), denial of service (DoS), or unauthorized access.\n- **Techniques**: \n  - *Execution*: Exploitation of vulnerable services (T1210)\n  - *Persistence*:"
