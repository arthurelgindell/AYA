Identify Attack Vectors and Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK):**\n\n- **Initial Access:** The exploit targets Apache Tomcat's JNDI lookup feature, which can be triggered by sending a maliciously crafted request.\n- **Execution:** Exploit execution occurs when the server processes this malicious request, leading to remote code execution (RCE).\n- **Persistence:** The attacker may attempt to maintain access by installing backdoors or modifying configurations.\n- **Evasion Techniques:** The exploitation could be obfuscated to avoid signature-based detection. This may include encoding, encryption, or using polymorphic techniques.\n\n**2. Detect Evasion Attempts and Obfuscation:**\n\n- Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) like Snort to look for patterns indicative of the exploit attempt.\n- Implement deep packet inspection (DPI) tools to uncover obfuscated payloads within network traffic.\n-",
