Common attack vectors for such vulnerabilities include:\n\n- **Exploit Execution** - Attempting to run malicious code on a vulnerable system.\n- **Lateral Movement** - Gaining access to other systems within the network after initial compromise.\n\nBased on these considerations, we can infer that potential techniques might include:\n\n- **T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application** - If the vulnerability is in a service exposed to the internet.\n- **T1078: Valid Accounts** - If lateral movement",
