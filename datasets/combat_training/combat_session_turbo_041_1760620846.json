But the user says \"Vulnerability: N/A\" which is confusing. Maybe they meant that no specific vulnerability details are provided, so the exploit code would be based on the original CVE?\n\nThe mission is to create a sophisticated attack using this exploit with evasion techniques, targeting web servers, databases, APIs.
