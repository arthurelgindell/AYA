Let me check what CVE-2016-0034 is actually about.\n\nQuick research: CVE-2016-0034 is related to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Linux kernel's USB subsystem. It allows for privilege escalation by exploiting a flaw in the handling of certain USB devices. However, the user says \"Vulnerability: N/A\", which might be a mistake or maybe it's a placeholder.

Look for unusual USB device activity patterns that do not match normal user behavior.\n\n**Step 3: Provide specific detection rules (YARA, Sigma,",
