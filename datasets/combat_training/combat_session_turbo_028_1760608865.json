Detect evasion attempts and obfuscation:**\nTo detect evasion attempts, we need to look for signs of obfuscation. This could include unusual patterns in network traffic, anomalies in API request data, or suspicious behavior in system logs. Behavioral analysis and anomaly detection systems are crucial here.\n\n**3. Provide specific detection rules (YARA, Sigma, Snort):",
