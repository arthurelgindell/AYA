From what I remember, CVE-2019-1579 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Netfilter framework, allowing an attacker to gain root access by exploiting a race condition in the nf_tables module. So the exploit would involve triggering this race condition to escalate privileges.\n\nThe user specified that the attack needs evasion techniques, targeting realistic systems like web servers, databases, or APIs.
