Let's consider common targets. Web servers often run Apache or Nginx, and maybe there's a vulnerability in their handling of certain requests. Since the exploit code isn't provided, I have to assume it's something that can be leveraged through HTTP requests or similar methods.\n\nFor evasion techniques, I need to think about how attackers typically bypass detection.
