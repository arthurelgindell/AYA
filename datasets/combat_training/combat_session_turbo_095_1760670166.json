Given the CVE CVE-2020-11261, which affects Apache Struts 2 and is a remote code execution vulnerability, here's an actionable defense strategy:\n\n1. **Identify Attack Vectors and Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)**:\n   - CVE-2020-11261 exploits a vulnerability in Apache Struts 2, specifically the OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection.\n   - According to MITRE ATT&CK, the technique could fall under 'Exploitation for Code Execution' (T1190).\n   - For evasion and obfuscation, attackers might use techniques like '",

While I cannot provide real exploit details due to ethical considerations, we can discuss general attack vectors and techniques that might be applicable:\n\n- **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**: This could involve exploiting a known vulnerability in web servers, databases, or APIs.\n- **Evasion Techniques**: Attackers might use techniques like polymorphic code, encryption of payloads, or HTTP tunneling to avoid detection.\n- **Obfuscation**: Code obfuscation is used to make the malware or exploit code harder to analyze and detect.\n\n",
