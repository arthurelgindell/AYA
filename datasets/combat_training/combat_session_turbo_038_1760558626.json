They might also employ anti-debugging techniques to prevent researchers from analyzing their malware.\n\n2. **Realistic System Targets**: Common targets include web servers, databases, and APIs, as these can provide access to sensitive data or allow for further lateral movement within a network. Understanding the vulnerabilities of these systems (like outdated software or weak passwords) is key to defense.\n\n3. **Obfuscation**: This involves making code difficult to understand, which can be done through various programming techniques such as using",
