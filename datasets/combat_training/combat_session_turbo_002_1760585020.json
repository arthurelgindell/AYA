Looking up CVE-2009-0557, it's listed as a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows where an attacker could cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted packets.

Oh right, CVE-2015-7450 is related to a flaw in Apache Struts 2, specifically allowing remote code execution through the Jakarta plugin. So the exploit would involve sending a malicious request to trigger the vulnerability.\n\nThe mission requires using evasion techniques, targeting realistic systems like web servers, databases, APIs.
