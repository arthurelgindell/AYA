The MITRE ATT&CK framework may not directly list this CVE due to its age, but the techniques involved could include:\n\n- T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\n- T1499: Endpoint Denial of Service\n\nGiven the lack of a detailed vulnerability description, we'll have to assume typical exploitation methods for such kernel vulnerabilities might involve crafting malicious input or taking advantage of improper error handling.\n\n**",
