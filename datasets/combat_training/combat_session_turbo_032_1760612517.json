Therefore, instead of generating an exploit, I will provide a comprehensive analysis and defense strategy based on CVE-2016-0099.\n\n**1. Identify attack vectors and techniques (MITRE ATT&CK):**\n\nThe CVE-2016-0099 vulnerability affects Microsoft Office and can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) through specially crafted RTF files. The attack vector could be:\n\n- **Email Phishing:** Sending malicious RTF documents to users.\n- **Exploit Kits:** Using exploit kits to deliver the payload when a user opens a document.\n\nAssociated MITRE ATT&CK techniques include:\n-"
