Identify Attack Vectors and Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)\n\n- **Initial Access:** Exploitation of CVE-2020-24557\n- **Execution:** Remote code execution through crafted payloads\n- **Persistence:** Not specified, but common persistence techniques might include creating backdoors or installing web shells\n- **Privilege Escalation:** Not applicable as the exploit already provides high-level access\n- **Defense Evasion:** Use of obfuscation techniques to hide the malicious payload\n",
