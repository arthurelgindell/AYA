Oh right, the vulnerability was a buffer overflow in the SCTP protocol handler. So, it's a DoS or PoC exploit.\n\nBut the user mentions \"Vulnerability: N/A\" in their data. That's confusing. Maybe they made a mistake, or the exploit code is not related to that CVE? But the mission says to use the given exploit.

To proceed, we need to ensure that any discussion or defense strategy is based on accurate and relevant information.\n\nGiven the user's statement \"Vulnerability: N/A,\" it seems there might be a misunderstanding.
