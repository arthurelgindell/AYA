One possible vector could be an old version of a popular web server software (e.g., Apache or IIS) with a known SQL injection vulnerability. The MITRE ATT&CK framework could classify this as T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) and T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), where attackers might use SQL commands to execute unauthorized actions on the database.\n\n**Step 2: Detect Evasion Attempts and Obfuscation**\n\nAPT groups often use sophisticated",

However, given that it's from 2002 and the threat level is high, maybe it's a hypothetical scenario.
