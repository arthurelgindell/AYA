I should look up what CVE-2014-2817 actually refers to.\n\nAfter a quick check, I find that CVE-2014-2817 is related to the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy and mod_proxy_ajp, allowing remote code execution. So the vulnerability is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw in Apache when using AJP connectors. That makes sense for an exploit targeting web servers.
