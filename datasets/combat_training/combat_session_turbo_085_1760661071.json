The MITRE ATT&CK framework suggests several tactics and techniques that could be used:\n\n- **Initial Access:** Exploitation of Vulnerability (T1190)\n- **Execution:** Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059), Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)\n- **Persistence:** Server Software Component (T1505), Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts (T1547.001)\n- **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscated Files or Information",
