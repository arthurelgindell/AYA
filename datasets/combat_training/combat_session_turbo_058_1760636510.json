For this example, let's assume it could be a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in a web server component.\n\n**Potential Attack Vectors and Techniques:**\n- **T1190**: Exploit public-facing application\n- **T1505.003**: Web shell\n- **T1071**: Application Layer Protocol (for C&C)\n  \n### 2.
