That's a common one.\n\nAlright, assuming it's the Log4j vulnerability. The mission is to create an attack with evasion techniques, target real systems like web servers, databases, APIs.

The attack vector typically involves sending a specially crafted string to an application that uses Log4j for logging. The JNDI injection can lead to remote code execution (RCE).\n   - **Techniques**:\n     - *T1190* - Exploit Public-Facing Application\n     - *T1027* - Obfuscated Files or Information\n     - *T1071",
