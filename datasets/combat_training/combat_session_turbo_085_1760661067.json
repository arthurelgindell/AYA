Identify Attack Vectors and Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)\n\nFirst, we need to assume the type of vulnerability CVE-2024-8957 might represent based on common high-severity vulnerabilities. Without specific details, we'll consider a generic approach:\n\n- **Exploit Title:** CVE-2024-8957\n- **Potential Techniques (Based on CVE Type):**\n  - *Exploit Public-Facing Application* (T1190)\n  - *Remote Code Execution* (T1059",
