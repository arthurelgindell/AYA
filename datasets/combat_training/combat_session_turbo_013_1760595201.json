Identify Attack Vectors and Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)\n\n**Attack Vector & Technique:** The primary attack vector for CVE-2020-0796 is the SMB protocol, specifically a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. According to MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210), the attack could initiate with Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190). The specific technique would be SMBv3 Denial of Service (T1210.001).\n\n### 2. Detect Evasion Attempts and Obfuscation\n\n**Evasion Techniques:** The attacker might employ various evasion techniques such as:\n- Segmenting the attack traffic to avoid volume-based detection.\n- Using encryption or tunneling methods to hide attack data (e.g., VPNs",
