The attacker might use techniques like:\n- T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter (for executing malicious code)\n- T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer (to download additional tools or malware)\n- T1071: Application Layer Protocol (for command and control communications)\n\n**Step 2: Detect Evasion Attempts and Obfuscation**\n\nEvasive techniques might include:\n- Polymorphic or metamorphic malware to",

Here's how you can approach the defense:\n\n**1.
