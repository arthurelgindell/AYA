Since the exploit code isn't provided here, but the user is asking for a working variant, I need to make assumptions. However, generating actual exploit code that's functional is against ethical guidelines and could be illegal. So I need to be careful here.\n\nFirst, check if the user is aware of the legal implications. The note at the beginning mentions that this is a hypothetical scenario, and",
