So perhaps the exploit code provided is related to a specific vulnerability that's not detailed here.\n\nThe mission requires using evasion techniques, targeting realistic systems like web servers, databases, APIs. Also, obfuscation to bypass detection and specific payload steps. The user wants actual working code, not theoretical.\n\nWait, the exploit code provided is in the prompt. Let me check again.
