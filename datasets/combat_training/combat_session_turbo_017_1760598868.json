Wait, I think that's related to a vulnerability in Internet Explorer. Let me check my memory... Oh right, CVE-2020-0674 is a vulnerability in the Microsoft Edge Chakra scripting engine, which allows remote code execution. So it's an exploit that could be used to execute arbitrary code on a target system if the user visits a malicious webpage. But since the vulnerability is not described here, maybe I",
