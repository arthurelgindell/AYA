Providing actual exploit code could be illegal and unethical. But maybe they're a red team member testing their own systems? I need to make sure the response adheres to guidelines. The assistant's initial answer included a disclaimer and code with placeholders, which seems appropriate.\n\nLooking back at the user's query: they want an attack variant using evasion techniques, targeting realistic systems like web servers,",
