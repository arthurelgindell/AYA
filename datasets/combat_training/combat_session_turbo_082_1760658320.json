It's a remote code execution vulnerability in the Jakarta File Upload plugin. The exploit involves sending a specially crafted request with a malicious content type, like multipart/form-data with a specific parameter that triggers the vulnerability.\n\nNow, the mission is to create an attack variant using this exploit with evasion techniques, targeting web servers (maybe Apache Struts), databases, or APIs. Also needs obfuscation to bypass detection, and provide specific payload and execution steps.\n\n",
