From my knowledge, CVE-2020-0796 is related to the SMB protocol, specifically a vulnerability in Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB) that allows remote code execution. It was patched in March 2020, so any exploit using this would need to bypass existing mitigations.\n\nThe user mentioned that the exploit code is provided, but they're asking for a variant with evasion techniques.
