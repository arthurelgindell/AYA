Techniques could include the use of web shells, exploitation of vulnerable services (T1190), and command and control (C2) communications (T1071).\n\n**2. Detect Evasion Attempts and Obfuscation:**\n\nAPT groups often use obfuscation techniques like polymorphic",

However, the Vulnerability field is listed as N/A here, which might be a mistake or perhaps they mean it's not specified.
