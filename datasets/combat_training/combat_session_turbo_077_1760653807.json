Plus, obfuscation to bypass detection.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what CVE-2019-4716 is. Let me check my knowledge base. Wait, CVE-2019-4716 is related to a vulnerability in the Samba software, which allows for elevation of privilege. But if the user says the vulnerability is N/A, maybe they have a specific context",
