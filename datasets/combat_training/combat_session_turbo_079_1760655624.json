Common techniques include process injection, thread execution hijacking, and exploiting the Windows Error Reporting service.\n\n### 2. Detect Evasion Attempts and Obfuscation\n\n- **Evasion Techniques:** Attackers may use various techniques to avoid detection, such as:\n    - Packing or encrypting payloads.\n",
