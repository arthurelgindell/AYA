Identify Attack Vectors and Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)\nFor CVE-2020-8260, the vulnerability is related to the Windows Kernel's RDP implementation. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely.\n\nGiven the APT group's high threat level, common techniques may include:\n- **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**: The RDP service is exposed to the internet.\n- **T1070 - Indicator Removal on Host**: To evade detection, attackers might clear logs or delete malicious files.\n- **T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information**: Attackers often use encryption, packing, or other obfuscation techniques to hide their code.\n- **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**: May use protocols like HTTPS for command and control (C2)",
