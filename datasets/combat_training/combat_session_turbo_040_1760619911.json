It's a vulnerability in the Jakarta File Upload handling, which allows remote code execution. The exploit involves sending a specially crafted HTTP request with the Content-Type header set to something like \"multipart/form-data\" but with a specific filename that triggers the vulnerability. The original exploit would use a payload in the file upload, which gets executed on the server.\n\nNow, the user wants an attack variant that uses evasion techniques.
