Given its release date, it's assumed that many systems would have been patched by now, but unpatched or legacy systems remain at risk.\n\n### Attack Variant Concept\n\n1. **Evasion Techniques**:\n   - **Obfuscation**: Use JavaScript or VBScript to obfuscate the exploit code. This can involve encrypting parts of the code and decrypting them at runtime.\n   - **Anti-Analysis**: Add checks to see if the code is being run in a sandbox or virtual environment, and exit",
