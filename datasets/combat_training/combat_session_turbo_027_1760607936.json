Let me start by recalling what that vulnerability entails. From what I remember, CVE-2018-18325 is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache Struts 2. It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by manipulating the Content-Type header in a request. The exploit typically involves sending a crafted HTTP request with a specific payload.\n\nNow, the mission requires using evasion techniques.
