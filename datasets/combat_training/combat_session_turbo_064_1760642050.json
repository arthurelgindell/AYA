The CVE provided is CVE-2021-22555, but the vulnerability field is listed as N/A. That's a bit confusing because usually CVEs are linked to specific vulnerabilities. Maybe there's a mistake in the data, or perhaps it's referring to a different aspect of an exploit.\n\nNext, the mission requires using evasion techniques. Evasion can involve things like obfuscation of code, polymorphic payloads, or using legitimate processes to hide the attack. Since it's targeting web servers, databases, APIs, I need to think about common services like Apache, MS SQL, or REST APIs. The user also wants the code to be working, so I have to make sure it's not theoretical but functional. However, providing actual exploit code could be harmful if misused, so I need to balance between",
