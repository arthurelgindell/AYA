This includes using non-descriptive variable names, complex data structures, and nested loops.\n2.  **Anti-Debugging Techniques:** The exploit code includes anti-debugging techniques to make it difficult for debuggers to attach to the process. This includes using timing-based checks, thread-local storage, and exception handling.\n3.  **Dynamic Payload Generation:** The payload is generated dynamically using a combination of compression and encoding techniques.
