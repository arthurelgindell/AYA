Common vectors for such vulnerabilities include:\n\n- Exploitation of unpatched systems\n- Misconfiguration or default credentials\n- Malicious network traffic\n\nBased on this, the potential MITRE ATT&CK techniques could include:\n- T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application\n- T1047 - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)\n- T1078 - Valid Accounts\n\n**2.

The exploit works by sending a malicious request with a crafted Content-Type header to trigger the vulnerability, leading to remote code execution. So, the exploit code would involve sending such a request.\n\nNext, evasion techniques. To avoid detection by IDS/IPS or AVs, I should consider methods like encoding the payload, using obfuscation in the exploit code, maybe splitting the attack into multiple stages, or using encryption.
