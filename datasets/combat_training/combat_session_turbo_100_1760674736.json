A quick recall: CVE-2017-0210 is related to a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, specifically in the way it handles certain RTF files. It's an exploit that uses a malicious RTF file to execute code remotely. But the user mentioned \"Vulnerability: N/A\" which might be a mistake, but I'll proceed with the assumption that it's the Office vulnerability.\n\nThe persona is an APT group, and the threat level is high.
