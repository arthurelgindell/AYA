However, the user mentioned that the vulnerability is listed as N/A, which might be an error or a placeholder. Maybe they meant that the exploit code is available but the specific vulnerability details aren't provided here.\n\nNext, the mission requires using evasion techniques. So I need to think about how to bypass typical security measures. Techniques like encoding, polymorphic code, or using legitimate system tools could help.

According to MITRE ATT&CK, this could fit under the 'Exploitation for Privilege Escalation' technique (T1068). To defend against this, you should implement application control and privilege access management solutions to limit the ability of users to escalate their privileges.\n\n2. **Detect Evasion Attempts and Obfuscation:**\n   - Attackers may use various evasion techniques such as packing, polymorphism, or encryption to avoid detection",
