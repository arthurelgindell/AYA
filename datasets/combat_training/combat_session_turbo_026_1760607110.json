Evasion could include things like code obfuscation, anti-VM checks, polymorphic code, or using legitimate system tools to mask the attack. Also, targeting realistic systems like web servers, databases, or APIs. So I need to think about how this exploit would be applied in those environments.\n\nObfuscation is key here.
