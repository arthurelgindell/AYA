Without specific details on Vulnerability Type and Affected Products, we'll consider general attack vectors for web servers and databases:\n\n- **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application:** Given that CVEs often pertain to public-facing applications, this attack vector is likely.\n- **T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** If the vulnerability can lead to elevated privileges, this could be the end goal.\n- **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol:** Use of common protocols (HTTP, HTTPS)",
