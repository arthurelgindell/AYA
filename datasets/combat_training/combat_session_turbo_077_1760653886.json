This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system. Based on the APT group's profile with high threat level, we should consider sophisticated techniques like:\n\n   - **Execution** (T1059): Exploiting the CVE to run malicious code.\n   - **Persistence** (T1547): Techniques like creating a new service or modifying an existing one to maintain access",
