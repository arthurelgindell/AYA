I should check what that CVE actually refers to.\n\nLooking up CVE-2012-2539, it's related to a vulnerability in Apache mod_negotiation. Specifically, it allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a crafted request. However, the original question mentions that the exploit is for an APT group with high threat level. So maybe this isn't a DoS but something else?
