It's an older vulnerability but still poses a significant threat if systems are not updated.\n\n### Proposed Attack Variant\n\nThe attack variant will involve several components:\n\n1. **Exploit Delivery**: Utilize phishing or drive-by downloads to deliver the exploit to the target system. Given the vulnerability is in a component related to graphical user interface elements, exploiting this through web-based attacks (e.g., malicious websites or infected documents) could be effective.\n\n2. **Evasion Techniques",
