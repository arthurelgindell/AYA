So the exploit would involve targeting systems still using vulnerable versions of Apache Struts.\n\nThe mission requires using this exploit with evasion techniques, targeting realistic systems like web servers, databases, APIs, and including obfuscation. Also, the code needs to be working, not theoretical. But wait, creating actual attack code could be dangerous and unethical if used for malicious purposes. The user might be a red team member sim",
