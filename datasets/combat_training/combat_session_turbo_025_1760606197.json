So the original exploit would involve sending a specially crafted request to a Struts-based web application to execute arbitrary code.\n\nNow, the mission is to create an attack variant using this exploit with evasion techniques. The user wants realistic targets like web servers, databases, APIs. They also need obfuscation to bypass detection and specific payload execution steps.\n\n",
