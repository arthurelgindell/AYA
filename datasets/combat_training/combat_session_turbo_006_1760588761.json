Wait, I remember that CVE-2019-0752 is actually related to a vulnerability in the Windows SMB client. It's an elevation of privilege vulnerability, allowing attackers to gain system-level privileges without authentication by sending a specially crafted message. So the exploit would involve sending an SMB request to trigger this elevation.\n\nNow, the user wants a variant of this exploit with evasion techniques.
