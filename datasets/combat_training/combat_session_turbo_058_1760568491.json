Once a target is identified, the attacker could use evasion techniques such as:\n\n- **Encrypted Communication**: Using HTTPS or other encrypted protocols to hide the exploit code and payload from network defenders.\n- **Code Obfuscation**: Modifying the exploit to make it harder for security software to detect,",
