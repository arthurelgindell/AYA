I need to check what CVE-2015-3113 actually refers to.\n\nLooking up CVE-2015-3113, it's related to a vulnerability in the Windows kernel, specifically in how it handles certain objects. It allows elevation of privilege through a race condition. So the exploit would target that to gain higher privileges on a Windows system.\n\nThe persona is an APT group, and the threat level is high. The mission requires using evasion techniques, targeting realistic systems like web servers, databases, APIs, including obfusc",

Identify Attack Vectors and Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)\n\n**Attack Vector:** The exploitation of CVE-2015-3113 allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on a Windows system. This typically involves a local attack vector where an attacker has already gained initial access to the system.\n\n**Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs):**\n- **Privilege Escalation - Exploit [T1068] and Evasion [T1027]:** The attacker is likely to exploit CVE-2015-3113 using a crafted input that triggers the race condition, possibly obfuscated to evade detection.\n- **Defense Evasion [T1140]:** The use of rootkits or other means to hide the presence on the system.\n- **Obfusc",
