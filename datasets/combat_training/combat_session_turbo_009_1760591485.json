Identify Attack Vectors and Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)\n\n**Attack Vector:** The vulnerability CVE-2014-0546 is a Windows kernel privilege escalation flaw, which could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system. This typically involves exploiting a buffer overflow or improper access control issue.\n\n**Techniques:** Based on historical use of similar vulnerabilities, attackers might utilize techniques such as:\n- T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\n- T1055: Process Injection (to execute code in the context of other processes)\n- T1107: File Deletion (after achieving their goals to cover tracks)\n\n### 2.
