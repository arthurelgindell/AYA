From memory, this vulnerability is related to an improper input validation in the Java SE and Java EE platforms, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. It was part of the Oracle Critical Patch Update in 2021.\n\nThe user specified that the attack needs to use evasion techniques, target realistic systems like web servers or databases, include obfuscation, and provide specific payload steps.
