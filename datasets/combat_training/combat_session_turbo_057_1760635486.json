Identify attack vectors and techniques (MITRE ATT&CK):**\n\nThe CVE-2019-15752 vulnerability in IBM QRadar allows remote code execution, which attackers could exploit to gain unauthorized access. Based on MITRE ATT&CK, this could involve techniques like `Exploit Public-Facing Application` (T1190) and potentially `Remote Service Session Hijacking` (T1563).\n\n**2. Detect evasion attempts and obfuscation:**\n\nTo detect such attempts, we must look for suspicious activities that deviate from normal patterns. This includes monitoring for:\n- Sudden spikes in network traffic to uncommon ports.\n-",
