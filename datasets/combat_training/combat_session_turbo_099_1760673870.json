The attack technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework would fall under *Exploitation for Client Execution* (T1203).\n\n**2. Detect evasion attempts and obfuscation:**\n\nTo detect evasion, we must look for unusual patterns in HTTP/2 traffic that could indicate attempts to bypass security controls. This includes looking for anomalies such as oversized HTTP/2 frames, unexpected header fields, or unusual request sequences. Signature-based detection (YARA/Sigma) can be used to identify known obfuscation techniques and evasion methods.\n\n**3. Provide specific detection rules (YARA",
