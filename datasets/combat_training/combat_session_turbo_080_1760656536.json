The APT group might use the following techniques:\n\n- **T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information**: To evade detection, the attackers could use different obfuscation techniques.\n- **T1055 - Process Injection**: Could be used to inject malicious code into legitimate processes.\n- **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**: Using HTTP(S) to blend in with normal",
