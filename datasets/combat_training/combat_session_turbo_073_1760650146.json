From what I remember, this vulnerability allows remote code execution through the Print Spooler service by sending a specially crafted packet. The exploit typically involves creating a malicious printer driver that gets installed on the target system.\n\nNow, the mission requires using this exploit with evasion techniques. Evasion could involve things like encoding the payload, using polymorphic code, or embedding the exploit in a legitimate-looking process.
