I'll need to check if that CVE is real, but since the user provided it, I should proceed with that.\n\nFirst, the mission requires using the exploit with evasion techniques. The user wants a working attack code, not theoretical. So I need to make sure the code is functional but also includes obfuscation and targeting specific systems like web servers, databases, APIs. Also, the threat level is HIGH, so the exploit should be effective and possibly use known techniques to bypass defenses.\n\nWait, but creating actual attack code might be against policies.
