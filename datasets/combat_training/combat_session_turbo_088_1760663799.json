Oh, right, that's a real vulnerability in the Apache Log4j library, which is part of the Log4Shell family. That's a remote code execution flaw. So the exploit would target that vulnerability.

Identify Attack Vectors and Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)\n\n**Attack Vector:** Network\n**Techniques:**\n- T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application (using CVE-2023-4211)\n- T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter (for execution post-exploitation)\n\n### 2. Detect Evasion Attempts and Obfuscation\n\n**Detection:** Look for unusual network traffic patterns to public-facing Log4j instances, specifically requests that include malicious JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) strings. Monitor for abnormal system behavior post-connection that could indicate successful exploitation.\n\n### 3. Provide Specific Detection Rules (YARA, Sigma, Snort)\n\n**YARA Rule Example:**\n",
