The user wants working code, not theoretical.\n\nFirst, I should consider what kind of vulnerability CVE-2024-8956 might be. Since the vulnerability isn't listed, maybe it's a hypothetical scenario. But I need to make assumptions. Common vulnerabilities include buffer overflows, injection flaws, misconfigurations, etc. Let's assume it's a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a web application, which is common and allows attackers to",
