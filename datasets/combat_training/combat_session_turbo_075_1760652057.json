And they want working code, not theoretical.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what CVE-2022-21587 is. Since the vulnerability isn't listed, maybe it's a placeholder or the user expects me to use common techniques. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, but I'll proceed assuming that the exploit code is provided by the user. Wait, the user mentioned \"EXPLOIT CODE:\" but didn't include it.
