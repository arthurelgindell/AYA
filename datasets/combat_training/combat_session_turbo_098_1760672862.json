Oh right, that's a vulnerability in Apache NiFi related to the handling of certain expressions which could lead to remote code execution. So, the exploit would involve crafting a malicious request that triggers this vulnerability.\n\nNow, the user wants an attack variant with evasion techniques. Evasion could include things like encoding the payload, using obfuscation methods, or splitting the attack into multiple stages. The target systems are web servers, databases, APIs\u2014so maybe Apache NiFi instances",
