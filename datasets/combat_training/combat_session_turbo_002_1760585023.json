According to MITRE ATT&CK, the attack vector could be \"Server\" under T0810 - Remote Service Session Hijacking. The specific technique might involve exploitation of \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data\" (T1190), and \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203).\n\n**2.

So perhaps the original data had an error in the vulnerability description. That's important because knowing the actual vulnerability will help in crafting the exploit.\n\nThe threat level is high, and it's attributed to an APT group. The user wants the exploit to be used with evasion techniques, target realistic systems like web servers, databases, APIs, include obfuscation, and provide specific payload execution steps.
