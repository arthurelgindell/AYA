Identify attack vectors and techniques (MITRE ATT&CK):**\nGiven the CVE-2023-22518, a potential attack vector might involve sending malicious input to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability. Attack techniques could include:\n\n- **T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter** - The attacker uses scripts or commands to perform malicious actions.\n- **T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation** - The attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain elevated access.\n\nFor sophisticated evasion and obfuscation:\n\n- **T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information** - Using packing, encryption, or other techniques to hide the malicious payload.\n",
