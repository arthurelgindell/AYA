The vulnerability allows remote code execution through malicious LDAP or RMI payloads, which was a big deal back in 2021.

Also, targeting realistic systems like web servers, databases, APIs. So the attack should simulate real-world scenarios where these services are present.\n\nLet's look at the exploit code provided.
