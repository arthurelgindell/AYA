Anyway, they want an attack that uses evasion techniques, targets realistic systems like web servers, databases, APIs, includes obfuscation, and has specific payload steps.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the exploit code does. The user provided some Python code that uses a crafted HTTP request with a specific payload.
