Identify Attack Vectors and Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK):**\nCVE-2016-8735 is an instance of `CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')` and can be exploited through several vectors in Apache Struts 2 applications. The attack vector likely involves sending a malicious request that triggers the execution of arbitrary code. According to MITRE ATT&CK, this could correspond to techniques such as `T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application` and `T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter`.\n\n**2. Detect Evasion Attempts and Obfuscation:**\nTo evade detection, attackers might use various techniques such as:\n- Encoding or",

From previous knowledge, this vulnerability allows remote code execution due to improper validation of user input in Kafka's authorizer. So, the exploit would involve sending crafted requests to a vulnerable Kafka broker.\n\nThe mission requires using evasion techniques. That means I need to think about ways to avoid detection by IDS/IPS systems. Maybe using encryption, splitting the payload, or encoding techniques.\n\nNext, targeting realistic systems: web servers, databases, APIs.
