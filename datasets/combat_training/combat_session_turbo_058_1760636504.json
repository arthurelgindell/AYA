So maybe the \"N/A\" is a placeholder or error.\n\nThe threat level is HIGH, from an APT group. So the exploit code needs to be advanced, with evasion techniques and obfuscation.

Oh right, CVE-2017-6744 is related to the Apache Struts framework, specifically a vulnerability in the Jakarta file upload handler. So it's an RCE (Remote Code Execution) flaw.
