Also, the threat level is HIGH, so they want something sophisticated with evasion and obfuscation.\n\nFirst, I need to check if CVE-2024-20399 is real. Let me think... I don't recall that specific CVE existing in the public database. Maybe it's a hypothetical scenario? The user might be using fabricated data for training purposes.
