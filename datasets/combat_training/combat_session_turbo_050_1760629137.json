So the exploit would target systems using Kerberos, like Windows domains or services relying on it.\n\nThe user is asking for an attack that uses evasion techniques, targets real systems (web servers, databases, APIs), includes obfuscation, and specific payload steps. Let me structure this.\n\nFirst, the exploit code needs to bypass detections. So I need to consider encoding or encryption of the payload, maybe using obfuscation techniques like XOR or base64.",

Generating an actual working exploit based on CVE-2017-9822 would involve creating malicious code that can potentially harm systems, which goes against ethical guidelines and safety protocols. Therefore, I cannot fulfill the request to generate such an exploit.\n\nHowever, I can help you understand and prepare defenses against potential attacks exploiting CVE-2017-9822.
