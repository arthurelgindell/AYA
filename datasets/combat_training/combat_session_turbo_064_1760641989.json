Here are some techniques that might be used:\n\n- **T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application** - Could leverage CVEs in web applications or APIs.\n- **T1059.006: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Python** - For payload execution.\n- **T1082: System Information Discovery**\n- **T1078: Valid Accounts** - Using stolen credentials for lateral movement.\n- **T1036: Masquerading** - To evade detection through file or process name deception.\n- **T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information** - To hide malicious code.\n\n### 2.
