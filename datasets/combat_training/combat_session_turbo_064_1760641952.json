The threat level is HIGH, and it's an APT group exploit.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what CVE-2014-4123 actually is. Wait, I recall that CVE identifiers typically have a specific issue described in the CVE database. If the vulnerability field is listed as N/A, that's unusual. Maybe it's a mislabeled CVE?
