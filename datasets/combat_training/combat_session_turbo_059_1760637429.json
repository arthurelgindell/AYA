Based on the high threat level and APT group persona, we should consider advanced persistent threats (Tactics: Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion).\n\nGiven the environment - web servers, databases, APIs \u2013 we might see:\n\n- **T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application** - Targeting exposed services.\n- **T1055: Process Injection** or **T1547: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - For persistence and",
