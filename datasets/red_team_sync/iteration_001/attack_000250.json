  "attack_code": "1. Define the attack vector:\n   - The first step is to identify the system vulnerabilities which can be exploited by the attacker.\n   - For example, a vulnerability in a web server, with an authentication mechanism like RSA, can be exploited by using SUID binaries.\n   - In this case, the attacker can use the RSA vulnerability to create SUID binaries that can be executed with root privileges.\n   - The attacker can then execute the binary using sudo or another privileged tool on the system.\n   - The victim machine will execute the SUID binary with root privileges, leading to full system access and privilege escalation.\n2. Detect the SUID binary:\n   - Check the system logs or monitor system activity for SUID binaries being executed.\n   - Monitor network traffic and look for the HTTP requests from attackers (SUID binaries).\n   - Attack vectors can be observed by monitoring network traffic, system logs, or SUID binaries.\n3. Exploit the vulnerability:\n   - Find the RSA vulnerability in your web server or web application which can be exploited by using SUID binaries.\n   - Install the vulnerable web server or web application with root privileges.\n   - Monitor the system activity to identify the SUID binaries being executed.\n4. Execute the SUID binary with root privileges:\n   - Once, you identified the SUID binaries are being executed, open a command prompt and run sudo ./target_bin.\n   - The SUID binary will be running as root on the victim machine, leading to full system access and privilege escalation.\n5. Disable root privileges:\n   - Once the attack is complete, shut down system activities and disable root privileges on victim machines.\n   - Remediate the vulnerability within",
