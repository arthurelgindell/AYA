  "attack_code": "Supply Chain Attack Targeting Software Updates:\n\nAttack Overview: The main objective of this supply chain attack targeting software updates is to gain unauthorized access to companies' computer systems and gain control over their network. This attack is carried out through the installation of a \"backdoored\" software update, which is designed to be more secure than usual. Once the attacker has gained control over the software update, they can gain access to critical systems and data.\n\nTargeting Venue: This supply chain attack is carried out against software update distribution centers or managed service providers (MSPs). MSPs have the responsibility to maintain the security of these systems and provide backup solutions in case they fail. Attackers use this opportunity to gain access by compromising the MSP's network, installing a backdoor in the software update distribution system or by performing malicious activities on this network.\n\nAttack Methodology: The attack is carried out through phishing attacks, manipulating software update email templates and bypassing security protocols to gain unauthorized access. Attackers use a code injection tool, which steals the administrator's credentials to install and run backdoored updates.\n\nTargeted Victims: The following organizations are the main targets of this supply chain threat, namely:\n\n- Managed Service Providers (MSPs)\n- Software update distribution centers (SUDCs)\n- Microsoft-hosted software updates\n- Industry-specific software update distribution centers\n\nConsequences: This supply chain attack has severe consequences on organizations' infrastructure, security posture and cybersecurity practices. The potential risks to businesses include data theft, loss of confidentiality and trade secrets, system downtime, computer malfunctions, cyber espionage and cyber sabotage.\n\nActions:\n-",
