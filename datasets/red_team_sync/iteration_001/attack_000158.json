  "attack_code": "A multi-stage APT attack campaign is a complex style of cyberattack that involves multiple stages and the use of multiple tactics and techniques. The aim of a multi-stage APT attack is to gain greater access and control over an organization or network, as well as to avoid being detected by security teams.\n\nThis attack campaign follows the following stages:\n1. Phase 1: Scanning and reconnaissance - The initial stage of the attack involves an intrusion into an organization's network or systems. The threat actors gather information about the target's environment, technical infrastructure, and personnel.\n2. Phase 2: Lateral movement - Next, the threat actors execute a more aggressive and sophisticated phase of the attack designed to gain access to an organization's information systems. During this stage, the threat actors may use multiple techniques such as social engineering, phishing campaigns, and malware distribution.\n3. Phase 3: Operation - The final stage involves the complete compromise of the organization's systems. Through spearfishing, remote access, or brute-force attacks, the threat actors gain control of all critical systems. They may also introduce malware into the network or disguise their operation as legitimate business transactions.\n\nThe use of multi-stage APT attack campaigns demonstrates the threat actors' ability to adapt and escalate their tactics and techniques as they progress through different stages of the attack. This style of attack is often highly complex and requires a well-planned campaign with several layers of defenses.\n\nAs the name implies, targets are split into multiple stages, with each stage focused on achieving a specific objective. In other words, the attackers may split their targets into zones to limit their objectives and have more control over these areas.\n\nIn conclusion, following multiple stages of a multi-stage APT attack",
