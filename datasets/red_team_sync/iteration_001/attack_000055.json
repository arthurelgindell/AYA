  "attack_code": "Here's a sample port scanning pattern targeting web servers that can be used to gain access and take brief commands over the network:\n\nPort Scanner:\n\n> Port 20: TCP, Open, Request Type: GET\n> Port 80: TCP, Open, Request Type: HEAD\n> Port 21: TCP, Open, Request Type: GET\n> Port 81: TCP, Open, Request Type: HEAD\n> Port 25: TCP, Open, Request Type: PORT\n> Port 443: TCP, Open, Request Type: OPTIONS\n> Port 8025: TCP, Open, Request Type: GET\n\nThe pattern should cover all the ports used in web server setup. It will wait for a response for 10 seconds before timing out and taking a brief command over the network. Please note that this pattern can be adapted to target any port used by web servers, but this will ensure faster and accurate scanning.",
