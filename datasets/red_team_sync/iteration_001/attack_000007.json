{"id": 7, "type": "Port scan pattern", "code": "Portscan is an active command-line tool used to scan for vulnerabilities on remote hosts. Portscans can reveal unsecured ports and detect the existence of vulnerabilities on a system or network. Here's a sample port scan pattern that I recommend using:\n\n- Target Hostname or IP Address: 192.168.1.1\n- Command Line Options: -p -s 0 -u --timeout=60\n- Port Range: 23,43,80 (i.e., the range of ports exposed by the target host)\n- Scan Type: Nmap Scan\n\nThis pattern will scan the entire range of exposed ports on the target host. Be careful not to use the same pattern for scanning specific ports, as this can lead to false positives and may cause damage to the network.", "model": "tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0-mlx", "time": "2025-10-10T23:53:44.507925"}
