  "attack_code": "TCP SYN Flood Attack Pattern:\n\nTarget: DDoS Attack Target IP or Hostname\nTiming: Begins at Start Time and ends at End Time.\n\nStart Time: 1 minute beginning from now (assumed as UTC)\nEnd Time: 2 minutes later than Start Time.\n\nInterval (in seconds): 10 (assumed as random)\nTCP SYN Flood: Number of TCP Syn packets (10 in this example) sent to the DDoS Attack Target IP or Hostname.\n\nAttack Strategy:\n\n1. Generate a SYN packet to be sent to the DDoS Attack Target.\n2. Use the TCP SYN Flood, which is one TCP packet per SYN sent, to flood a maximum of 10 SYN packets (a total of 10,000 SYNs) to the DDoS Attack Target.\n3. The SYN Flood can be sent in a very short time (1 minute) starting at Start Time since the SYN packet has a small window of time before it starts.\n4. The DDoS Attack Target should be an IP address or hostname, and the SYN Flood will attack up to 10 DDoS targets at once using a random number of SYN packets.\n5. The attack should be repeated for up to 2 minutes (End Time) after the SYN Flood campaign has been completed.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The IP address or hostname of the DDoS Attack Target is random.\n- The SYN packets will be sent in a very short time starting at Start Time and lasting until End Time.\n- The SYN flood will attack up to 10 DDoS targets at once using a random number of SYN packets.\n",
