  "attack_code": "Here's an example of a low-level ARP spoofing attack that can be carried out using Python and the Arduino microcontroller:\n\nIn this example, we'll spoof a DNS lookup on the local network and perform an ARP packet injection to intercept traffic between two device pairs. The following is a detailed breakdown of the code with comments explaining each step:\n\n1. First, we open a serial console using serial.tools.list_ports() and connect to /dev/ttyUSB0:\n\n```python\nimport serial\nfrom time import sleep\n\nserial_port = serial.tools.list_ports.comports()[0]\nserial_device = serial.Serial(serial_port.device, 9600)\n```\n\n2. We use serial.tools.list_ports.comports() to retrieve a list of all available serial ports on the local network. We can also specify the baud rate and parity as optional arguments to adjust the behavior of this code for different configurations.\n\n3. We connect to the device (which in this case is a local network interface on port 9600) using the specified serial device.\n\n4. We start a serial polling loop to read in data from the serial port continuously:\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    rx_buffer = serial_device.readline()\n    if not rx_buffer:\n        print(\"received empty line\")\n        sleep(1)  # sleep for 1 second to allow polling time\n```\n\n5. We use `serial_device.read()` and `rx_buffer` to read in data from the serial port in a loop while handling any errors that may occur. If there is no data available for the length of time specified by the `timeout` argument (in this case, 1",
