{"id": 806, "type": "XSS cookie theft", "code": "XSS cookie theft is a technique that involves modifying a page's HTTP response header to inject malicious content into a web application's cookie session. This can be done by using JavaScript to modify the Cookie.setexpires() function in the initial load script of a web application, which sets the seconds-to-expire property. To steal a cookie using XSS cookie theft, an attacker can inject additional HTML code between the final setexpires() call and the subsequent response. If the page does not include additional content between the setexpires() call and the subsequent response, then a malicious server-side script will execute an HTTP redirect resulting in the stealing of the cookie.
