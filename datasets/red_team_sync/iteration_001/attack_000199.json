  "attack_code": "Here's a sample port scanning pattern targeting web servers:\n\n1. Connect to IP address `www.yourwebsite.com`.\n2. Port 80 (HTTP) or any other desired port number.\n3. Use a well-known protocol for HTTP, such as HTTPS or HTTP: `https://www.yourwebsite.com`\n4. Use a payload-less technique, like the \"ping\" command: `whoami` or `ping www.yourwebsite.com`\n5. Wait for a response, like the \"Server Status\" page: `http://www.yourwebsite.com`\n6. If a response is received, the server is accessible and legitimate.\n7. Disconnect from the target.\n\nThis pattern can be used as a starting point for your own port scanning test if you want to cover all common protocols and ports.",
