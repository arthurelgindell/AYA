  "attack_code": "To conduct a SQL injection attack targeting an authentication form, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to a web application that has an authenticated login form.\n2. Enter the credentials of a known user, for example, \"username\": \"password\" and \"user: password\".\n3. Press enter after submitting the login form, to execute the SQL code in the attack.\n4. Observe the server logs for any injection attempts, and examine the SQL code injected into the database.\n5. Analyze and determine whether the attack is successful, by checking for any changes made to the database.\n6. Test this against various known vulnerabilities in web application sources and identify any known weaknesses.\n7. Extract the authentication details from the database into plain text, such as usernames and passwords.\n8. Construct a SQL query to execute against the database using credentials that were obtained from step 3.\n9. Compile the SQL query into a string, and execute it using a prepared statement or prepared/unprepared SQL statement.\n10. Check for any errors with the authentication attempt, such as an unsuccessful login or connection issues.\n11. Collect information on the attack, including user credentials and any malicious changes made to the database.\n12. Apply additional checks, such as checking for authentication error logs or verifying login attempts using unique validation mechanisms.\n13. If the attack is successful, provide an informed report of the SQL injection and any weaknesses in authentication procedures.",
