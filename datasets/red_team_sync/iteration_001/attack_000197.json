  "attack_code": "Sure! Here's a sample code that generates a DOM-based XSS for a JavaScript framework vulnerability:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <title>JavaScript Framework Vulnerability</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <!-- This is the HTML code for a page that displays the vulnerability -->\n    <div id=\"vulnerable-component\">\n      <!-- The JavaScript code to insert the vulnerable component -->\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nLet's assume that the vulnerable component is a `<div>` element that contains some JavaScript code, such as:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  console.log('Hello, world!');\n</script>\n```\n\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would either need to have access to the vulnerable component (in which case they could add malicious JavaScript code and run it) or steal the vulnerable component's contents (in which case they could insert malicious code into it).\n\nTo generate this DOM-based XSS for the vulnerability, we can load the JavaScript component into a webpage, and then add the vulnerable component in HTML code. This is done by creating a new `document` object, finding the vulnerable JavaScript component within it using `.querySelector()` method and creating a new `div` element inside the vulnerable component. Finally, we append both components to an HTML container using `.appendChild()` method.\n\nTo test this vulnerability, we can visit the webpage and inspect its DOM tree with tools like Firebug or Developer Tools. The vulnerable component will show up in the console log of a JavaScript error message.",
