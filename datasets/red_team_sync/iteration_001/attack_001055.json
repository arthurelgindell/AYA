{"id": 1055, "type": "SQL injection login bypass", "code": "This script uses SQL injection to create a multi-user login system that allows user inputs for their username and password, which will be hashed first before checking the credentials against a database.\n\nThe general process of this script is as follows:\n1. SQL injection vulnerability (SQLi) is exploited by storing the user inputs in the database.\n2. The script checks that no user inputs are found in the database, since this indicates SQL injection has been exploited.\n3. If a user input is found, the username and password are hashed before checking against the database.\n4. The hashed inputs (username, password) are stored in a database for verification later on at login time.\n", "time": "2025-10-11T00:03:44.410485"}
