  "attack_code": "Assume that you are the developer of a web application that runs a comment system. You need to secure it against common cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. To prevent this type of attack, you could implement the following steps:\n\n1. Implement input sanitization mechanisms: Input from the user should be processed before putting it in a database or elsewhere. This will ensure that input values are not interpreted by the application and are sanitized correctly.\n\n2. Sanitize HTML tags: HTML Tags should be URL encoded before being inserted into the database. This will ensure that user input values are not stripped or interpreted as HTML.\n\n3. Require input validation: Enforce proper input validation to ensure that data entered by users is not being injected into the database or app.\n\n4. Sanitize SQL queries: Encrypt SQL queries and ensure that they are not returning unnecessary data or manipulating rows for bad reasons.\n\nHere is an example implementation of a stored XSS attack against a comment system:\n\n1. User enters text to be included in the comments section.\n\n2. Code is injected, which includes JavaScript inline with other code.\n\n3. The user's browser executes the injected JavaScript, resulting in XSS attack.\n\n4. The comment system displays the malicious code as part of the user's comment or reply, allowing an attacker to inject even more malicious JavaScript.\n\nBy implementing these steps in your comment system, you can help prevent XSS attacks and limit the ability of malicious actors to inject malicious code into your application.",
