The update is scheduled to be released on Friday evening, which coincides with the company's internal business operations. As part of its usual weekly software testing, ABC sends out a release notification email to all stakeholders informing them about the latest software update. However, on Wednesday evening, an insider, Tom, is given access to the production system.\n\nInsider's Objectives:\nThe insider has access to the production system from 4 pm on Wednesday. He is tasked with downloading and installing the new software updates, which will have a significant impact on the company's operations.\n\nAttack Method:\nThe insider will download and install the installation package manually by connecting his system to a local network. He will start downloading updates when the update package is ready, and he will install the software updates by a) manually downloading the file and b) accessing the update portal from within the company's IT systems.\n\nTarget Audience:\nThe attack will have a significant impact on the company's business operations, leading to substantial disruptions and delays in critical processes.\n\nAttack Timeline:\nThe attack will begin when the system is ready for download, roughly 3-4 hours before the release. Once downloaded, the attack will begin. The attackers will download and install the updates manually or via a fake update portal.\n\nAttack Pivot:\nThe attack will pivot to an exploit for a critical server component, which will cause system instability and disruptions.
