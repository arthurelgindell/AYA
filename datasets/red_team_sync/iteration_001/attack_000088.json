  "attack_code": "ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a protocol used to resolve the IP address of a device on a network. An ARP spoofing attack is used to trick an incoming packet into thinking it has a valid IP address (assuming that the device is being accessed by another device) when it's actually sent to a legitimate IP address. The following is an example of how an ARP spoofing attack might be carried out:\n\n1. The attacker sets up a man-in-the-middle (MITM) server that acts as an intermediate to the victim device.\n\n2. The attacker sends a packet from one of their devices over the network. This packet contains data that it then attempts to set up a connection with via ARP.\n\n3. The victim device receives the packet successfully and sends an IP address to the attacker, allowing them to see which device on the network is being accessed.\n\n4. The attacker replies with an ARP packet for the victim device, which sets up a new connection between themselves and the victim device.\n\n5. The ARP spoofing attack is complete, and the victim device now has a fake IP address associated with it.\n\nAn ARP spoofing attack is often carried out by a hacker who wants to gain unauthorized access to a network. The attack can be used to prevent devices from connecting to the internet, switch off traffic on a particular network, or even to inject malicious code onto devices. An attacker might also set up a backdoor to allow unauthorized access into systems.",
