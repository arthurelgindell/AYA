  "attack_code": "Title: Comment System Attack using Stored XSS for Admin Admin Only Login!\n\nIntroduction:\nLarge websites almost always have a comment system, which allows users to leave feedback or comments for other users. These comment systems usually use AJAX functionality to load the comments quickly and efficiently, but they are also vulnerable to XSS attacks.\n\nAttack:\nIn this attack, we will create a stored XSS vulnerability in the comment system. We will exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into comments, making it so that any user with the password of the attacker can add new comments.\n\nPreparation:\nBefore we start writing our code, we need to prepare a server where we can store the malicious JavaScript code. We will use a PHP script that will create and execute the stored code after it is loaded with AJAX.\n\nCode:\nTo achieve our goal, we will first create a PHP script using the following code:\n```php\n<?php\nsession_start(); // Start a session so that we can store data later\nif (isset($_POST['submit'])) { // If the submit button is clicked\n    $content = $_POST['comment_content']; // Get the comment content\n    \n    // Store malicious JavaScript code into the session\n    $_SESSION['stored_js'] = $content; // Store malicious JavaScript code in session\n    \n    echo '<script>if( ! verify() ) { alert(\"Error: XSS attacks are not allowed!\"); } else { add_comment(); } </script>'; // Inject malicious JavaScript code into comment system\n}\n?>\n```\nLet's call this new script `add_comment.php`.\n\nTo test our attack, we will create a dummy comment system using PHP and HTML. We'll add some malicious JavaScript code to the `<script>` tag of our new comment",
