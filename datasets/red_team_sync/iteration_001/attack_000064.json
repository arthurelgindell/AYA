  "attack_code": "To create a SQL injection attack targeting a login form with authentication bypass, follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a webpage that contains sensitive information such as login form, password field or username input element.\n2. Create a PHP script that exploits the vulnerability by injecting SQL commands using a backdoor technique.\n3. Load this script in the targeted web page following the HTTP request protocol.\n4. Once logged in, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information via SQL injection techniques.\n5. Attackers can trigger this bypass by entering SQL commands directly into the login form or through a malicious JavaScript script.\n6. The sensitive information can include usernames, passwords, session IDs and authentication tokens.\n7. Once attackers gain unauthorized access to this sensitive information, they can perform any actions such as deleting, modifying or even creating new accounts.\n\nTo protect against this vulnerability, here are some best practices to implement:\n\n1. Always use secure protocols such as HTTPS for delivering web content to the user, including login forms.\n2. Limit the input of sensitive information as much as possible by using JavaScript function invocation, encoding input values and sanitizing inputs during input processing.\n3. Implement input validation mechanisms to prevent SQL injection through input fields, form submissions or any other interaction with the web server.\n4. Use of session fixation prevention techniques such as CSRF tokens and secure cookie handling to prevent session hijacking.\n5. Implement user authentication, authorization or identity management solutions to protect sensitive information.",
