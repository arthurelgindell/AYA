The login page has login inputs with encrypted input values, while all operations are done over SSL/TLS channels. The program accepts parameters from the command line and generates database table schema using a SQL injection vulnerability. Once the program is executed, it opens a MySQL instance and uses prepared statements to make SQL injection attacks.\n\nInstallation:\nTo install this program, download the code and extract it to a directory on your computer. Open NodeJS and install Dependencies using NPM. Once the program is installed, type in your desired options during a command prompt run.\n```bash\nnode index.js", "time": "2025-10-10T23:57:57.299560"}
