  "attack_code": "Here's a step-by-step process to generate DOM-based XSS for a JavaScript framework vulnerability:\n\n1. Identify the vulnerable function and its input parameters that contain user-supplied data.\n2. Write a malicious JavaScript file containing the function and its inputs that will trigger the XSS vulnerability when executed by a user.\n3. Pack the malicious JavaScript file into an HTML template using jQuery or another DOM manipulation library.\n4. Submit the packaged HTML template to a web server through a fake HTTP request or protocol.\n5. The server will automatically execute the malicious JavaScript script and generate an XSS vulnerability with user-supplied data in its output.\n\nThis process will generate a DOM-based XSS vulnerability for the specified function and its inputs.",
