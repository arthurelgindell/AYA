In this buffer overflow exploit for privilege escalation, we will demonstrate a Double-Blind Exploitation approach to exploit an xSS vulnerability in Apache Struts 2.\n\n1. Background:\n\nApache Struts 2 is a popular open-source web application framework for building fast and scalable web applications. It provides built-in support for input validation, form submission, and security measures such as authentication, authorization, and session management. However, Struts 2 is vulnerable to a wide variety of buffer overflow attacks like buffer overflows in input validation functions, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE) via HTML parameter handling, and more.\n\n2. Exploitation Techniques:\n\nTo exploit Apache Struts 2, we will employ a Double-Blind Exploitation approach where the attacker first simulates a valid user request, and then leverages an existing vulnerability to inject malicious code into the application.\n\n3. Attack Scenarios:\n\nWe will demonstrate some attack scenarios where we can exploit such vulnerabilities by leveraging existing weaknesses:\n\n1. Injecting HTML Tags with Malicious Code via XSS: The Apache Struts 2 framework allows user-defined HTML tags to be rendered within a form, and the XSS vulnerability introduced by a malicious user can be exploited to inject a malicious code snippet.\n\n2. Injecting Input Values via HTML Form Encoding: The Struts framework allows user-defined HTML forms to be rendered, which can",
