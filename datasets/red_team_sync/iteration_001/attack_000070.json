  "attack_code": "TCP SYN Flood Attack Pattern:\n\nSYN Flood Attack - TCP SYN (Syn Selective) is a type of TCP flooding attack where the attacks aim to send continuous \"SYN\" packets.\n\nAttack Scenario:\n \n1. Configure a server to send \"SYN\" packets periodically using the TCP SYN Flood Attack.\n 2. Once the server receives a SYN packet, it sends an ACK packet with the following payload:\n    \"SYN, Ack=10, Window=65536, Urgent Pointer=0\"\n 3. If the destination machine receives this packet, it replies with an ACK packet instead of a SYN packet.\n 4. The process repeats until the attacker is satisfied with the number of SYN packets being sent to the server.\n\nTCP SYN Flood Attack Pattern:\n\nIP Addresses: 192.168.3.11\nPorts: 23 (TCP)\nAttack Scenario:\n1. Set up a router with IP address 192.168.3.11\n2. Configure a server on the same network with IP address 192.168.3.11 (excluding the port number)\n3. Run DDoS attacks using:\n   - Socks proxy to mask the origin of the attacks\n   - Random time between each attack and avoid detection (especially in proxies)\n   - UDP flooding with SYN packets sent at intervals between 1-5 seconds\n4. Check firewall logs and traffic analysis tools to identify the IP address and port being attacked\n5. Analyze the SYN packets sent by victim machine to identify pattern, and test with a known attacker",
