  "attack_code": "A cybercriminal gains access to a company's network through a phishing attack. The phishing email, sent via email client software, looks legitimate and claims to be an order for the delivery of a new product. The email seems too good to be true, with slick graphics and promises of delivery within hours.\nThe recipient clicks the link in the email, leading them to a website that looks legitimate. Once on the website, they're sent to a captcha page, which is designed to test whether they're human or not. After passing the captcha, the victim is taken to a landing page that looks similar to a legitimate product order confirmation page. However, this landing page is set up for delivery of an elaborate and well-planned social engineering scheme.\nThe victim is asked to enter their login credentials, which are then used for remote access purposes. Since they're already on the victim's network and have access to their files, the criminal can now use this remote access to gain full control of the company's network.\nNow that they have absolute control, the criminal sets up a series of fake phishing screens, each tailored to deceive the victim into providing more credentials. These screens are designed to look like legitimate login pages for various departments within the company, and each one includes a fake form that requires additional information to be submitted.\nOnce the victim provides the necessary credentials, they are redirected to a fake website that leads to screens filled with malware. This initiates the delivery of the malicious software onto the victim's computer, which is then used to steal confidential company data.\nOnce this happens, the criminal can now take over secure financial systems and change company accounting records. They're able to manipulate the company's finances, giving them full control over its financial statements and managing funds as they wish.\nThis scenario highlight",
