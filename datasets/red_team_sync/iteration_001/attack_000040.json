The script then generates a reverse ARP spoofing attack on the local\n# computer using the generated sequences. The script also outputs a list of sequence\n# numbers in descending order, so it can be used to plot graphically the attack. The\n# script requires that you run it with root privileges (sudo). Here's the full script:\n\n# Set the local IP address and port for ARP spoofing attack.\nIP=\"192.168.0.1\" IP_src=\"$( ip addr | grep 'br0' | awk '{print $2}' )\"\nPORT=53\n\n# Calculate packet sizes required for ARP spoofing attack.\nARP_RESPONSE_SIZE=\"$( echo \"0x${(Z$PORT)+$(zsh -c (printf '\\033[1;31m%x\\033[0m'))}\" | bc )\"\nARP_SEQUENCE_SIZE=\"$( echo \"0x${(Z$PORT)+$(zsh -c (printf '\\033[1;32m%x\\033[0m'))}\" | bc )\"\n\n# Generate",
