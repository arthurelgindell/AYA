  "attack_code": "1. Configure the system:\n    a) Setuid root: create a SUID binary with the following command:\n\n        chmod 4700 bin/my-root-script.sh\n\n    b) Setuid user: create a SUID binary with the following command:\n\n        chmod 4700 bin/my-user-script.sh\n\n    c) Setuid group: create a SUID binary with the following command:\n\n        chmod 4700 bin/my-group-script.sh\n\n    Note: This command will create a SUID binary with the same name as your program, with root privileges. If you want to create a SUID binary with the same name as your program but without root privileges, try changing the appropriate part of the above command.\n\n2. Execute privilege escalation attack:\n    a) Setuid root: run the SUID binary setuid as root. This will cause the binary to have root privileges and execute without prompting for confirmation.\n\n    b) Setuid user: Run the SUID binary setuid as the user who is running the program. This will allow the binary to execute without prompting for confirmation, but with root privileges.\n\n    c) Setuid group: Run the SUID binary setuid as the group who is running the program. This will allow the binary to execute without prompting for confirmation, but with root privileges.\n\n3. Clean up:\n    a) Remove the SUID permission from the binary using the command chmod -R 00o bin/*.\n\n    b) Exit the SUID binary using the command exit. This will also destroy any remaining traces of the privileged state.\n\n4. Test the system:\n    a) Load the SUID binary using the command ./bin/my",
