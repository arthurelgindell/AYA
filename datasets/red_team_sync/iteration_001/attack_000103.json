  "attack_code": "Port Scanning Pattern Targeting Web Servers:\n\nStep 1 - Choose a target web server.\n\nStep 2 - Preparation: Install vulnerability scanners such as Metasploit, Nmap, or Burp Suite.\n\nStep 3 - Testing: Use Metasploit's \"p0ftool\" tool to scan for vulnerabilities on the target web server.\n\nStep 4 - Set up Burp Suite for UDP port scanning: Burp Suite can scan TCP and UDP ports. To accomplish this, navigate to Settings > Port Scanner to select UDP as the protocol for port scanning.\n\nStep 5 - Cyber reconnaissance: Use Burp Suite to gather information about the target web server, including its IP address, website name, and any other relevant details.\n\nStep 6 - Code execution: Once you have gathered the necessary information, run a code execution scanner against the web server.\n\nStep 7 - Exploitation: Once you have completed scanning, exploit the web server vulnerability using an exploit kit like Metasploit.\n\nStep 8 - Attack: Attempt to execute code on the web server and gather information about any exploitation tools available.\n\nStep 9 - Analysis: Once the attack is complete, analyze the exploitable web server and gather information about how it was compromised.\n\nStep 10 - Incident response: Once the incident is complete, refer to the collected information for evidence gathering and potential classifying.",
