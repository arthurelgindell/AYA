Supply chain attacks can disrupt supply chains and cause significant financial losses, damage to reputations, and harm to businesses.\nTactical Ops: To launch a supply chain attack against software updates, cybercriminals would need to gain access to the IT infrastructure of a company that is responsible for issuing software updates. They will then try to compromise the credentials of IT staff or software developers responsible for updating software.\nMalware: Malware, such as ransomware, will be the primary tool of attackers during supply chain attacks. The malware will capture credentials or have access to IT infrastructure from both the supplier and distributor side.\nEscrow: Cybercriminals would be able to gain access to software updates, and they will use it to replicate attacks against the distributor's IT infrastructure or supply chain. They will use this to disrupt supply chains and cause financial losses for the distributor.\nStaged attacks: Cybercriminals will stage their attacks to create confusion and doubt among software update distributors. They will use staged announcements, fake or hijacked websites, and phishing emails to delay software updates for long enough before leaking sensitive information about future software updates.\nThreat actors: The supply chain attackers will use a mix of well-known threat groups, such as APT1 and APT28. They will also use new attack groups to disrupt supply chain attacks against software updates.\nIn this scenario, cybercriminals would be able to gain access to the IT infrastructure of the software distributor, including its web servers, databases, and email accounts.
