Such vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute malicious code on the victim's web application. This script demonstrates how to use a framework to generate DOM-based XSS attacks for JavaScript vulnerabilities.\n\nTools:\n1. Node.js (minimum version 8.0.0) - for running the script.\n2. Express (minimum version 3.4.0) - for hosting the web application.\n3. Chromium (minimum version 29.0.1586.0) - for running the web application using nodejs.\n4. Firebug (for debugging online) - for inspecting the web application using a plugin.\n\nSteps:\n1. Generate a web application using the Chromium browser (version 33.0.1867.0).\n2. Copy the generated files and paste them into a working web application running on the server.\n3. Open the console within the web application using Firebug plugin for debugging.\n4. Set up your web application to handle JavaScript-based requests and responses.\n5. Configure the Web Application Framework that you are using (e.g., Express) to use the XSS vulnerability.\n6. Add a new route that triggers an XSS injection attack by adding the following code to the server.js file:\n\n```\napp.post('/injectXSS', function (req, res) {\n  const string = req.body.string;\n  const cookie = 'foo=' + random_chars(8);\n  document.cookie = `bar=${escape(string)}; path=/; ${cookie}`;\n",
