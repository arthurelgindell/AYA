  "attack_code": "Oracle is a database management system that offers various features such as SQL syntax, schema creation, query execution, and data normalization. Blind SQL injection is a technique used to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in an application. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to generate time-based blind SQL injection for Oracle database using Python programming language.\n\nRequirements:\n- Oracle Database 19c or higher on Windows, Unix, or Linux.\n- Python programming language installed on the system.\n\nSteps:\n1. Install Oracle Database and its prerequisites. Installation instructions vary depending on the operating system you are using.\n\n2. Open a Python shell (command prompt or editor) and ensure that the Oracle Database installation directory is set to the default location.\n\n3. Execute a SQL injection test against Oracle Database using SQLmap tool.\n\n```python\nimport sqlparse\nfrom sqlparse import sqlparse\nfrom sqlmap import SqlMap\n\ndef generate_time(day, month, year):\n    timestamp = \"{{time}}\"  # Generate a random timestamp using the supplied day, month and year values\n    return f\"INSERT INTO {__tablename__} (datetime) VALUES ({timestamp})\"\n\ndef main():\n    sqlmap = SqlMap()\n    with open('connection.csv') as file:\n        connection_data = []\n        for lines in file:\n            try:\n                data = sqlparse.read_csv(lines)\n                connection_data += data['connection']\n            except ValueError:\n                print(f\"Invalid line {lines.lstrip()}\\nValid lines: '{file}'\")\n                exit()\n        connection_data = [line.strip(',') for line in connection_data]\n    tables = sqlmap(connection_data, name='table')\n   ",
