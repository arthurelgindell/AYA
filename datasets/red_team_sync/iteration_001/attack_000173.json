We have noticed a growing trend of attacks that are designed to exploit human weaknesses and manipulate them into succumbing to our demands.\n\nDescription:\nThis attack will target businesses and organizations that have either an existing social engineering program in place or a new initiative to implement one. The attack will be carried out through a series of phishing campaigns that use the insecurity of human weaknesses to gain access to important information.\n\nPretexting Scenario:\nOur pretexting scenario will target businesses that have just started implementing a social engineering program. We'll start by creating fake job postings, stating that the company has some new positions available. We'll then send emails to selected targets that will look and sound authentic.\n\nThe emails will be addressed from a company called \"Congegraphics Inc.\", asking the targets to contact them for job opportunities. The subject line will also have an emotional element, that is \"Dream Jobs at CGI\".\n\nWe'll have the email handle as \"CGI.Recruit@Congegraphics.com\"\n\nWe'll arrange for a fake video call where the target will be asked to schedule a phone interview with a candidate named \"Anna Smith\". This will look and sound convincing, and we'll ask the target to schedule a call with Anna Smith.\n\nWe'll send the interview invitation through email, using the attached file \"Anna Smith Resume\"\n\nWe'll also send a copy of the attached video call file to the target. \n\nTarget Responds:\nThe first target responds, booking a video call.
