These types of attacks can cause significant disruptions in the targeted organizations, leading to a loss of confidence from customers and competitors. This case study provides an example of a supply chain attack targeting software updates used to gain access to critical infrastructure.\n\nAttack Scenario:\nA group of attackers wants to gain access to the software updates management system (SUSMS) of a major electricity company. They assume that the SUSM system has no security measures in place, and they plan to exploit a major vulnerability by sending specially crafted software updates over the HTTPS protocol.\n\nTargeted Affected Organization:\nThe targeted affected organization is a major electricity company located in the United States. The attackers' goal is to gain access to the SUSMS system and then launch a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) on the electricity company's critical infrastructure.\n\nAttack Method:\nThe attackers will use a specially crafted software update to exploit a critical vulnerability within the SUSM system. The attackers will send the software update to compromised systems, which automatically download and install it without user intervention. Once installed on the system, the software update will be used to launch a DDoS attack against the electricity company's critical infrastructure.\n\nMethodology:\nTo achieve their objectives, the attackers will use a combination of phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks and lateral movement. The attackers will send specially crafted software update",
