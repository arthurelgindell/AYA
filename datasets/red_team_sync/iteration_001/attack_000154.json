  "attack_code": "Privilege escalation attack using SUID binaries is a security threat that allows an attacker to gainroot or root privileges on a system. The SUID (setuid) binary allows a process to set its own PID attribute with the -S option to change the ownership of the executable binary to root.\n\nAn attacker can use SUID binaries to gainroot or root privileges on a system. The binary would be setuid and then executed as root, granting them the full privileges of a root user. This can be done by replacing the file permissions and ownership when creating an SUID binary.\n\nHere are the steps to create a privilege escalation attack using SUID binaries:\n\n1. Create an SUID binary with a modified permissions and ownership in the file system.\n2. Run the modified binary as root.\n3. Once run, the binary will attempt to perform an exploit.\n4. If the exploit is successful, it will have root privileges on their own.\n\nNote: While this attack can be done using SUID binaries, it requires a custom binary or malware. Security solutions like Defender or BitDefender do not support SUID binaries due to the security risks they pose.",
