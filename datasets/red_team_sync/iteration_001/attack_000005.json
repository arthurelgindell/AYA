  "attack_code": "In this write-up, we will discuss a type of DOM-based JavaScript vulnerability called XSS (Cross-Site Scripting). This vulnerability can be enabled by using JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React or Vue.js.\n\nOverview:\nXSS is a type of vulnerability where attackers can inject malicious content into the DOM (Document Object Model) where a third-party script is running. This can be exploited by the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.\n\nPrevention:\nTo prevent XSS vulnerabilities, developers can use best security practices such as sanitizing input, validating form data and ensuring cross-site scripting protection. For Angular or React development, developers can use libraries like aurelia-templating-router to build a better developer experience with performance and security.\n\nExample:\nLet's consider the following scenario:\n\n1. In a web application, we have an HTML file that renders the user interface using Angular or React. Let's say the file has a feature which adds dynamic content to the element on-the-fly.\n\n2. To implement this feature, you can use an Angular component or a React function component like below:\n\n```html\n<ng-template #content>\n  <div class=\"dynamic-content\">Dynamic Content</div>\n</ng-template>\n```\n\n3. In the component or function, you can use JavaScript to add dynamic content dynamically, and it won't run on the client side. However, this is happening under the hood in the background.\n\n4. In this scenario, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the component's template using an HTML editing tool like Visual Studio Code or a web browser extension.\n\nStep-by-step Guide:\n1. Choose an appropriate version of JavaScript framework like",
