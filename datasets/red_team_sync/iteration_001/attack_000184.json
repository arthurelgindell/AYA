  "attack_code": "Let's say you are running a server application that requires encryption to protect sensitive data. To thwart attacks, an attacker could attempt to perform ARP spoofing:\n\n1. The attacker creates a fictitious network interface between the server and client on the same LAN.\n2. The attacker sets up an ARP (Adress Resolution Protocol) spoofing trap, which tells any connected devices to believe that the ARP reply sent by the server is actually from a device on the same LAN as the one being spoofed.\n3. The attacker creates a new MAC address on their fictitious network interface and sets it as the correct one.\n4. The server responds with an ARP request from the original machine, which is then routed on to the attacker's interface.\n5. The attacker drops the ARP spoofing trap as soon as it sees the actual ARP reply, and replaces the fictitious MAC address with their own.\n\nThis would allow them to intercept and corrupt any data in transit, making it difficult for the server to prevent this attack. To mitigate the risk of ARP spoofing, you could take the following measures:\n\n1. Use a router with unique MAC address support to ensure all devices on your network use the same device's MAC address.\n2. Use encrypted networks to provide an additional layer of security to your network traffic.\n3. Limit the number of MAC addresses allowed on a LAN to prevent address reuse and ensure uniqueness for each device.\n4. Use WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) encryption to protect data transmitted over wireless networks.\n5. Use a firewall, intrusion detection system or antivirus software to detect and block ARP spoofing attacks.",
