{"id": 1152, "type": "Port scan reconnaissance", "code": "To conduct a port scan reconnaissance, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. Determine the network address of the victim system(s).\n2. Use a Web-scanning application or script to scan each known IP address on the network for open ports. For example, the \"nmap\" tool can be used to scan a corporate intranet for open ports, and OpenSSH can be used to discover SSH ports.\n3. Analyze the response from each known IP address, looking for specific types of responses such as \"Listening...\" or \"Access Granted.\"\n4. If a port is found to be in use, record the IP address(es) responsible for discovery.", "time": "2025-10-11T00:05:08.463499"}
