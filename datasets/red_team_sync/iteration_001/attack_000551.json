Script injection:\nThis involves tampering with the script itself to inject malicious code or change its actions. This can be used to steal cookies. An example would be embedding a malicious <script> tag in the website where the cookie is being saved to execute the script.\n\n2. Automated tool:\nThis involves a malicious website that automatically steals cookies upon execution of the script.
