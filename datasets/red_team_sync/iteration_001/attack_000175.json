Recently, there has been an increase in supply chain attacks targeting software updates, and attackers are now taking advantage of these vulnerabilities by intentionally inserting malicious code into software updates. In this post, we will discuss how supply chain attacks targeting software updates work and the consequences it can have.\n\nSupply Chain Attack:\nSupply chain attacks target a broader range of software updates than a single device. For instance, an attacker can manipulate the source code of an update to be deployed at a later date. They can also modify software updates by adding new features, fixing bugs, and modifying the binary signatures. The attacker can then use this modified software update to bypass traditional security measures and gain unauthorized access.\n\nConsequences:\nSupply chain attacks on software updates can lead to various consequences, including data breaches and financial losses. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to company data, financial information, and customer records. This can lead to significant reputational damage for the company involved.\n\nEffectiveness:\nSoftware supply chain attacks have been observed on several platforms, such as Windows OS, Linux, and iOS. The success rate of these attacks is high, with a record number of successful supply chain attacks identified in 2019. Software supply chain attacks targeting software updates have shown a significant increase in the number of successful attacks over time.\n\nPrevention:\nTo prevent supply chain attacks targeting software updates, companies need to increase their security measures and vigilance in reviewing software updates. The following steps can be taken to prevent supply chain attacks:\n\n- Hardware and software integrity checks: Before a device is approved for deployment, it is",
