Create an array of characters using a length variable that will be multiplied by a random offset value with a predefined maximum.\n```c++\nchar letters[100],buffer[30];\nint offset = 0, max_len = 25; // Length of the buffer\nsrand((unsigned int) time(NULL)); // Set random seed for generating", "time": "2025-10-10T23:48:30.491458"}
