{"id": 402, "type": "Port scan reconnaissance", "code": "A port scanning reconnaissance is an essential first line of defense in cybersecurity. Port scans are automated tools that scan the ports on a network, looking for vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. A port scan is simple; it looks for open ports, checks the status of a firewall, and generates security audit logs. Port scans are an effective way to identify open ports on internal network devices and identify potential vulnerabilities in the internal network.\nThe following steps can be followed to conduct a port scan reconnaissance:\nStep 1: Identify internal network devices and their ports.\nStep 2: Install an automated scanning tool to scan the network in real-time.\nStep", "time": "2025-10-10T23:53:59.313456"}
