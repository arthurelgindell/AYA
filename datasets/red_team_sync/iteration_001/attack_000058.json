  "attack_code": "Privilege escalation attacks on Linux system are often carried out using SUID binaries, which are setuid binaries. A setuid binary is a process with its executable file set to run with the same user ID as the file's owner.\n\nA typical scenario for a privilege escalation attack using SUID binaries is the following:\n\n1. A user executes a privilege escalation attack using SUID binaries to run the compromised binary.\n2. The binary is chrooted into a root directory, and its SUID flag is set to the victim's user ID.\n3. The binary then performs an operation with its own privileges, such as reading or writing files belonging to the victim user.\n4. Later, when the binary attempts to execute another program that needs elevated privileges, it fails with a permission denied error.\n\nLet's walk through an example scenario where the attack can be carried out using SUID binaries:\n\n1. An malicious user (let's call this user 'malicious') creates a root directory for the purpose of running an SUID binary with elevated privileges.\n2. The malicious user sets its user ID (uid120) to become the owner of the root directory.\n3. The malicious user then creates a SUID binary called 'mybinary', which has the 'world_owner' entry in the permissions table.\n4. The malicious user runs this SUID binary with elevated privileges using the 'chrootjail' utility, which chroot jailments in a root directory.\n5. The malicious user then performs an operation, such as reading a file with the '/root/bin/mybinary' name or executing code with elevated privileges.\n6. The 'chrootjail' utility fails with a permission denied error when attempting to execute the malicious",
