Once it executes, the session cookie will be stolen (via a simple hardcoded `set_cookie()` call), and any subsequent requests to that URL will return a 403 Forbidden error since the modified session cookie won't be able to access any of your web application's session-related functionality.\n\nTo make it more dynamic and exploitable, you could replace the hardcoded `set_cookie()` call with a PHP function that generates a random session cookie and copies it to the request URL.",
