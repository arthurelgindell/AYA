{"id": 63, "type": "Buffer overflow exploit", "code": "To generate a buffer overflow exploit, you need the following steps:\n\n1. Choose a payload that sets a buffer to accessable by the attacker (e.g., an ASCII string).\n2. Choose a buffer size and data that will overwrite the targeted payload in a buffer - this can be done by manually setting some sample values.\n3. Add padding (e.g., repeating the first or last bytes of the buffer) to an arbitrary size that makes the data inaccessible.\n4. Set the buffer pointer to the address where you want to overwrite the targeted payload.\n5. Initialize the data in the buffer (e.g., to random data or by calculating a checksum", "time": "2025-10-10T23:49:02.252244"}
