  "attack_code": "To create a killer remote code execution (RCE) exploit for your vulnerable system, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the vulnerability and its impact on your application/system. 2. Determine the path that a user would take to invoke the vulnerability, such as through an HTTP request or by sending malicious data through a network interface. 3. Build a shellcode that will execute code in the context of your application/system, executing the vulnerable code at a specific address. 4. Add this shellcode to your application/system, which can be wrapped in a library file so it can't be executed directly. 5. Build a payload that triggers the kernel's execve() system call, allowing your exploit to execute as root. 6. Compile the payload and library into a single executable file using a tool like Binfmt-tools. 7. Create a unique exploit ID that corresponds to the vulnerability being exploited. This will help you identify and track your exploits, which can be useful in gathering evidence or forensics. 8. Create a library file that wraps your exploit, making it easy for other libraries to use the exploit. This will make it easier to integrate with your system's own logic, allowing you to exploit multiple vulnerabilities at once. 9. Build a kernel module that includes your library and payload, making it easy to add or update the exploit without having to rebuild your entire system. 10. Test your RCE in a controlled environment before deploying it on the real system.",
