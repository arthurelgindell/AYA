  "attack_code": "TCP SYN Flood Attack Pattern for DDoS:\n\n1. Scan Targets: The first step of a TCP SYN flood attack is to scan a network for open ports. It consists of sending TCP SYN packets with UDP port numbers on each host in the network.\n\n2. Multicast Scan: The next step is to send the SYN packets using the multicast group address 234.56.78.90 on each host in the network.\n\n3. Infinite Scan: The attacker repeatedly sends SYN packets until the victim network becomes overwhelmed.\n\n4. Bottleneck Attack: The attacker can use the second layer of the OpenFlow protocol called Ethernet Edge Switching (EES) to allocate traffic to specific ports on the victim network.\n\n5. Slow Start: The attacker can also use packet loss to slow down the victim network, minimizing the effectiveness of the attack.\n\n6. Conclusion: In summary, a TCP SYN flood attack will send a sequence of SYN packets to the victim network with each host in the network receiving an additional packet. The attack will aim to overwhelm the victim network with SYN packets and cause a DDoS.",
