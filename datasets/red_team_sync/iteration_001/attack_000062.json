  "attack_code": "The following multi-stage APT attack campaign follows a \"pay-as-you-go\" approach, which means that the attackers will gradually increase their attacks in steps rather than launching a massive and synchronized campaign at once.\n\nStage 1: Initial Attack (~100Kbps)\nThe first stage targets remote servers of target organizations, focusing on security updates and critical patches. The attackers will send multiple messages to the target servers, typically delivered in the form of malicious web content such as PDF attachments disguised as security updates. The payload includes a malicious macro that injects a backdoor onto the remote servers, allowing the attackers to gain remote access and perform other actions.\n\nStage 2: Backdoor Installation (~140Mbps)\nThe backdoor is installed on the remote servers after a period of time, typically about 24 hours. The backdoor allows the attackers to perform remote administration tasks and gain persistence on the machines.\n\nStage 3: C2 Infrastructure (~100Mbps)\nThe attackers will establish a C2 infrastructure on the target servers. This C2 infrastructure will be used to manage the backdoor, obtaining remote administrative privileges and sending commands.\n\nStage 4: Exploitation (~1.3Gbps)\nThe attackers will exploit remote vulnerabilities such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on the servers, or SSH Daemon vulnerabilities. They will use this time to gather more information about the target organization's infrastructure, such as network devices and servers.\n\nStage 5: Multi-stage Attack (~4Gbps)\nAs part of the multi-stage attack, the attackers will slowly increase their attacks in waves. Each wave will include more remote servers to target, each",
