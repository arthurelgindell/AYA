  "attack_code": "Title: Generate DOM-Based XSS for JavaScript Framework Vulnerability\n\nDescription: Developers of a JavaScript framework rely on DOM manipulation to update the rendered page. This is where the vulnerability lies. By exploiting a vulnerable feature of the framework, remote attackers can create and execute JavaScript on the victim's browser, which may cause malicious code execution.\n\nPurpose: This app exploits this vulnerability to generate a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on the JavaScript client side and execute malicious code in the victim's browser.\n\nInstructions: Follow these steps to execute the XSS attack in your web application:\n\n1. Ensure that the JavaScript framework you're using allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n2. Run the app in a web server, such as Nginx or Apache, and visit the URL provided.\n\n3. Once you're inside the web server, create a new page and upload it to your server.\n\n4. Open the updated page in your web browser and click on some buttons to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n5. The app will generate a malicious script on the client side that will execute on the victim's web browser.\n\n6. Once executed, your JavaScript client will detect that it's not running on the same origin as the vulnerable server, causing an error.\n\n7. The attacker can then inject their malicious code into the victim's browser to execute it on your server.\n\n8. The updated page will then run the malicious code with no error, which may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on your server.\n\nRisks: This XSS vulnerability can lead to remote code execution on your web server. Once executed, your JavaScript client will be compromised with the attacker's mal",
