  "attack_code": "An attacker can use anomalous ARP packets to create a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. Here's how:\n1. The attacker sends a legitimate ARP packet to an untrusted device, pretending to be the device itself.\n2. Once received, the legitimate ARP packet includes the source IP and port information of the device being spoofed, enabling the attacker to impersonate that device without detection.\n3. The legitimate ARP packet is then sent to the compromised device, which receives it as intended.\n4. Once received, the legitimate ARP packet is changed, disguising it as an ARP packet from the device being spoofed.\n5. The attacker can then modify any ARP packets sent to or from the compromised device, making it appear that they were sent by the legitimate device.\n6. The attacker can modify any other communication protocols that were established between the two devices, such as DHCP or IPsec, allowing them to manipulate and intercept any traffic passing between the two devices.\n7. The attacker can use this power of spoofing to eavesdrop on or steal data from the compromised device.\n8. Once the compromised device is under attack, it can be mitigated by disabling the ARP spoofing functionality.\nHere's how to create a spoofed ARP packet:\n1. Prepare an ARP packet by including the source IP address and the expected destination MAC address of the new device.\n2. Ensure that your device is enabled for ARP spoofing by toggling the \"Enable ARP Spoofing\" option in your network interface settings.\n3. Set the packet type to \"ARP Request\" and the protocol to \"ARP\".\n4. Set the data payload to",
