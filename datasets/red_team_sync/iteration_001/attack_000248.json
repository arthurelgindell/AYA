  "attack_code": "During a typical IP security protocol like SYSPRIM, the server and client use unicast multicast packets to establish a connection between them. SYSPRIM uses UDP, which is an unencrypted protocol that can be intercepted and modified in transit. In a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, an eavesdropper intercepts SYSPRIM traffic between the server and client.\nHere's how an ARP spoofing attack can be used to carry out a MITM attack:\nStep 1: The attacker intercepts the SYSPRIM traffic between the server and client.\nStep 2: The attacker sends a fake SYSPRIM message with a different IP address to the server. (For instance, sending a fake SYSPRIM message with a different IP address using SYSPRIM's default RFC 8174 method.)\nStep 3: The server responds to the fake SYSPRIM message with a legitimate reply. However, it's intercepted by the attacker and used by them instead of the real server.\nStep 4: The attacker can now use this false server response to intercept the traffic flow between the client and the real server.\nStep 5: The attacker can then use this fake server response along with other malicious traffic to manipulate the flow of SYSPRIM messages between the client and the server.\nStep 6: The attacker can then use this fake client response along with other malicious traffic to manipulate the flow of SYSPRIM messages between the server and client.\nStep 7: The attacker can now send fake SYSPRIM messages to the client, which is intercepted by them and used by them. This creates a MITM attack.\nIn summary, an ARP spoofing attack can be used to carry",
