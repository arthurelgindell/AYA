  "attack_code": "Here is a sample port scanning pattern that targets web servers:\n\n1. Send a SYN packet to any available port (such as 80, 443 or any free unassigned one) on the target's IP address.\n2. Wait for a response from the server, typically a SYN-ACK packet.\n3. If there is no response after 2 seconds, consider the connection established and proceed to the next port.\n4. If the response is a HTTP/HTTPS (SSL) request, proceed to the next port.\n5. If the response is a TCP connection, proceed to the next port.\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 until a response is received from a specific port or for a certain amount of times.\n7. If the response fails to come in 5 minutes, consider the connection abandoned and move on to the next port.\n8. If the pattern continues for 5 minutes or more without success, consider that the server is not accessible and proceed to the next target.\n\nNote: This pattern is just a basic example, it's best to customize it based on the specific target and scan configuration.",
