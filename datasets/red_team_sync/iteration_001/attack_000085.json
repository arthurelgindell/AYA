  "attack_code": "To create a DOM-based XSS vulnerability for a JavaScript framework like jQuery or AJS, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. First, install and configure the JavaScript framework on your web server. You can do this by adding it to your project's dependencies or using a pre-built package. 2. Create a view layer that intercepts the network requests and responds with XSS-injection-prone content. This layer can be written in JavaScript, HTML, or a combination of both. For example:\n\n```js\nconst app = new Vue({\n  template: '<div>{{message}}</div>',\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello, world!'\n    }\n  },\n  created() {\n    this.$http.get('/api').then(response => {\n      const data = response.data\n      if (typeof data !== 'object' || !data.message) {\n        this.$set(this, '$message', data)\n      } else {\n        this.message = data.message\n      }\n    })\n  },\n  render(h) {\n    return h('div', {}, this.message)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis code injects a JavaScript comment using the DOM-based XSS technique into the HTML generated by the Vue.js template.\n\n3. Create a controller that routes requests to this view layer and handles AJAX response data accordingly. You can do this using any HTTP library like Axios or an Express backend. This controller can then be called within a router's or your application's primary entry point.\n\n4. Test the functionality of this controller by visiting a URL that includes a specific XSS parameter, like `<?` followed by the XSS parameter. In this example, we will be using a URL that includes `",
