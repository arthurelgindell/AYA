{"id": 873, "type": "Buffer overflow exploit", "code": "Title: Exploitation of a Buffer Overflow in Linux\n\nIntroduction:\nBuffer overflow vulnerabilities are one the most common types of security risks. The exploitation of buffer overflows in Linux is relatively easy since there are many standard libraries that use a null-pointer injection (NUI) method. The aim of this proposal is to write a simple buffer overflow exploit in C which will trigger a heap corruption, leading to a runaway process.\n\nSteps to create exploit:\n1. Implement a custom kernel function that triggers the heap corruption.\n2. Save an integer variable in the stack, e.g. \"a\"\n3. Set the value of a to some very large number", "time": "2025-10-11T00:01:14.242702"}
