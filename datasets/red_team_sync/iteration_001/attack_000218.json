  "attack_code": "SUID (Set Group ID and Permissions) is a technique used in privilege escalation attacks. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to create a SUID binary and launch it as root.\n\nSteps:\n1. Create a privileged user account (eg: root) within the Linux system using the following command:\n   ```\n   sudo adduser <user>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<user>` with your desired username.\n\n2. Create a SUID binary and change its permissions by the following command:\n   ```\n   sudo chmod 4755 /path/to/sid-bin.sh\n   ```\n\n   In this example, replace `/path/to/sid-bin.sh` with the full path to your SUID binary.\n\n3. Run the SUID binary as root:\n   ```\n   sudo /path/to/sid-bin.sh\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/sid-bin.sh` with the full path to your SUID binary.\n\nConclusion:\nThis guide has demonstrated how to create a SUID binary and launch it as root while running privilege escalation attacks. By using this technique, you can gain root privileges and perform other malicious activities.",
