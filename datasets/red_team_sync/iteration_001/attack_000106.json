  "attack_code": "A privilege escalation attack is a malicious attempt to gain complete access to system privileges (e.g., root or administrator) without being detected by the user or administrator. In this case, we will be using SUID (setuid) binaries.\n\nTo perform a privilege escalation attack using SUID binaries, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a SUID binary: This means \"set-user-id\" where the user ID is the privilege being granted. In this case, we are creating a binary with SUID permission set for root user.\n\n2. Change the execution permissions of the SUID binary: Execute the following command:\n\n```\nsudo chmod -x /bin/suid-binary\n```\n\nThis will execute the SUID binary as root with full system privileges.\n\n3. Install SUID binary on victim machine: If you want to attack a specific machine, run this command:\n\n```\nsudo cp /path/to/suid-binary /usr/bin/suid-full-root\n```\n\nIf you want to attack a specific user, use the `-u` argument for `sudo`, like this:\n\n```\nsudo cp /path/to/suid-binary /usr/bin/suid-full-user\n``` \n\n4. Test the SUID binary: To test if a user has been granted root privileges, simply run the SUID binary. If it succeeds, that user is now a root user.\n\nIn this way, we have created a privilege escalation attack using SUID binaries. The binary we compiled in this tutorial is called `suid-full`, which gives full root privileges.",
