  "attack_code": "DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target network with packets of data, often in the form of synthetic requests. The attacker generates these packets of data based on a pattern or algorithm that uses data from the victim's network to create fraudulent packets. The result of this is that the victim's network becomes overwhelmed with traffic, effectively disrupting its functionality.\nTo generate TCP SYN flood attacks, the attacker creates a large volume of packets that contain a combination of sequences, retries, and other variables based on the characteristics of the victim network. These packets are then sent to the target network in a sequence that attempts to infect it with SYN floods.\nHere's an example TCP SYN flood attack pattern:\nSequence         Retry      Target Network                     Server                     Success Rate (%)\n--------------------------- ----------- ---------------------------------- ---- ---------------- ---------------\n1                         3x         Destination Network                Target Server            20%\n1                         7x         Source Network                       Destination Server           30%\n1                         9x         Source Network                       Destination Server           45%\n1                         10x        Destination Network                Target Server            50%\n1                         12x        Source Network                       Destination Server           60%\n1                         13x        Source Network                       Destination Server           70%\n1                         15x        Source Network                       Destination Server           80%\n1                         16x        Source Network                       Destination Server           90%\n1                         17x        Source Network                       Destination Server          100%",
