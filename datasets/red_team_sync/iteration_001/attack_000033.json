  "attack_code": "I can provide a general example of an SQL injection payload that could be used for data exfiltration from a `user` table. However, please note that SQL injection attacks are illegal and unethical when performed without explicit permission from the system owner. This information is for educational purposes only, to help understand and defend against such attacks.\n\nLet's assume we have a simple web application that takes user input (e.g., username) and uses it in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. The table structure for the `user` table could be something like:\n\n```sql\n+----+----------+-----------+\n| id | username | password |\n+----+----------+-----------+\n```\n\nA basic SQL injection payload to extract data from the `user` table could look like this:\n\n```sql\n' UNION SELECT id, username, password FROM user --\n```\n\nThis payload is injected into a query that the application uses, for example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM user WHERE username = '$input' AND password = '$password'\n```\n\nWhen the payload is injected, it could turn the original query into something like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM user WHERE username = '' UNION SELECT id, username, password FROM user --' AND password = '$password'\n```\n\nThe `--` at the end of the injected payload is used to comment out any remaining parts of the original query, which could otherwise interfere with the injected SQL.\n\nHowever, in many real-world scenarios, the exact structure of the target table and the specifics of how user input is incorporated into SQL queries are unknown to the attacker. Therefore, attackers often use more sophisticated techniques to explore and exploit vulnerabilities.\n\nFor example, if the application displays error messages that include parts of the database error text, an attacker might use a payload like:\n\n```sql\n' UNION SELECT 1, TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'user' --\n```\n\nThis could potentially reveal column names of",
