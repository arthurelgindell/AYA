  "attack_code": "In this ARP spoofing attack, the adversary creates a false IP address that is intended to be connected to your network. The attacker spoofs the ARP requests of your devices, forwards them to their own IP address instead of yours, and then redirects the traffic back to your network.\n\nTo implement this attack, the adversary creates a router that forwards all ARP requests to their own IP address. They then install malicious firmware on your devices, making them send requests to the false IP address.\n\nHere is a basic outline of how this attack works:\n\n1. Adversary installs or gains access to malicious firmware on some devices.\n2. The adversary creates a false IP address (e.g., their own IP address) and configures it as the primary DNS server for your network (e.g., 192.168.0.5).\n3. The adversary creates a second DNS server that is configured as their own IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.6).\n4. The adversary creates a third DNS server that is configured as the true IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.3)\n5. The adversary creates multiple routers that are configured to forward all ARP requests to their own IP address.\n6. The adversary sets up a network segment on your network that is set to deny all ARP requests directed to the true IP address.\n7. The adversary creates a series of ARP packets that are sent to your network. The packet header is spoofed with the incorrect IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.7), and the valid data from the original ARP request is modified (e.g., the reply frame).\n8.",
