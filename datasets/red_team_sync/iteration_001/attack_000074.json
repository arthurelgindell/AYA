  "attack_code": "Privilege escalation attacks are designed to gain elevated system privileges such as root access or administrative functions. In this scenario, we'll be using a SUID binary to gain root privileges on a Linux machine.\n\nFirst, we'll create the SUID binary executable as follows:\n\n```\n$ cat setuid-binary.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nset +e # Exit immediately on error\nif [ -x \"$0\" ]; then\n    exec \"set \\$daemon_args \\\"$@\"\nfi\n```\n\nThis script uses the set command to run the SUID binary as root, passing an array of arguments to it.\n\nNext, we'll create a sample SUID binary executable called setuid-binary:\n\n```\n$ cat setuid-binary\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"This binary is running as root\" > /dev/stdout\nexit 0\n```\n\nAfter creating the binary, we'll create a simple script to launch it:\n\n```\n$ cat test.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nsetuid-binary & sleep 10 && kill $! || echo \"Failed to launch SUID binary\"\n```\n\nThis script will start the SUID binary, wait for 10 seconds, and kill any process that tries to execute as root.\n\nNow let's launch the binary:\n\n```\n$ bash setuid-binary.sh & kill -15 $(pidof setuid-binary)\n```\n\nThis will launch the SUID binary and automatically kill any process that tries to execute as root. The script sets a timer of 10 seconds and waits for the binary to launch before killing it.\n\nNow let's test our privilege escalation attack using this SUID binary:\n\n```\n$ ./setuid-binary <|user",
