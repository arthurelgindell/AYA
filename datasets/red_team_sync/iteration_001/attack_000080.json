  "attack_code": "Here's a SQL injection attack targeting a login form with authentication:\n\n1. Create a new PHP script in your web server that will handle any incoming POST requests to the login page. This script should display a messagebox and do nothing else on errors (which it will catch in the PHP code below).\n\n```php\n<?php\nsession_start();\nif(!isset($_POST['username'], $_POST['password'])) {\n    echo \"Error: missing input data\";\n} else {\n    $username = filter_var(trim($_POST['username']), FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);\n    $password = $_POST['password'];\n    \n    // database connection and query for user with matching username/password\n    \n    // if credentials match, redirect to login page\n}\n?>\n```\n\n2. To execute this script, use the following command line:\n   ```\n   php login.php\n   ```\n\n3. Visit the login page by typing the following URL in your web browser:\n   ```\n   http://localhost/login.php\n   ```\n\n4. Once you're on the login page, enter your username and password in the text boxes provided.\n\n5. Click the \"login\" button to perform an SQL injection attack. The login form will display a form field for the username, then validate it using $_POST['username'] as input. This is where our SQL injection happens:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '&username';\n```\n\n6. The login script will substitute the value for \"&username\" in the SQL query instead of the username field, causing a MySQL database error.\n\n7. If you try to log in with the same username and password, the script will redirect you back to the login page using the following code:\n\n```php",
