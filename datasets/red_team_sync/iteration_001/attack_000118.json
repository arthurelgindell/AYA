  "attack_code": "TCP SYN Flood Attack Pattern: \n\n(This is a generic attack pattern that works for any network protocol like TCP or UDP. It can be customized by the attacker depending on their preference.)\n\nTarget: A remote server running the specified network protocol.\n\nAttack Scenario: The attacker launches a TCP SYN Flood Attack against the specified network protocol targeted to a remote server.\n\nPreparation: The attacker creates fake connections with the remote server to simulate a huge number of TCP SYN packets. They create many pseudo-connections, each one created for a different IP address to spread the packets over multiple IP addresses and servers. The destination port number is initially set to Port 23, at which point the attack begins.\n\nCongestion Control: The attacker routes the SYN flood packets via a congestion control protocol to reach their destination. If the server has high congestion, the packet will be dropped before reaching its intended targets.\n\nEvasion Techniques: The attacker may try to bypass the congestion control protocol or evade detection by using techniques such as Forward Initiation Protocol (FIP), which creates random packets to make it difficult for the server to detect them.\n\nRules of Engagement: The attacker may play their cards close to their chest or keep them hidden.\n\nConclusion: The TCP SYN Flood attack is an effective tactic for attacking a server from a remote location. By using fake connections, the attacker creates multiple pseudo-connections that spread out their packets over different IPs or servers. The initial SYN flood packets are directed at specific targets, and the attack passes its attack signature onto that target.",
