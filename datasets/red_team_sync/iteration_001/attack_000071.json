  "attack_code": "Port Scanning Pattern Targeting Web Servers:\n\n1. Begin by checking your target's server status to determine its current availability. If the server is down, change direction by checking other ports.\n\n2. Use a popular multi-purpose scanning tool such as Nmap, Burpsuite, or Metasploit to scan for open ports on the target's IP address.\n\n3. Search for other services that can be used to access the target's resources, such as FTP, HTTP, or SSH.\n\n4. Use a reverse shell tool like Ctrl+C to automate the process of accessing target services, bypassing authentication.\n\n5. Use different methods to enumerate the target's server configuration, such as using a web interface or command line tools.\n\n6. Use vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and cross-site scripting to gain access to sensitive areas, such as database or file upload.\n\n7. Use command injection to control the execution of scripts, which can give the attacker access to certain parts of the system.\n\n8. Use brute-force attacks or dictionary attacking on known web services, such as WebAuthn or Cryptomator.\n\n9. Test various user accounts, role names and permissions to ensure they are not compromised as a part of the security testing process.\n\n10. Use port mapping to change the target's IP address by using a known or static value in your exploit.\n\n11. Test out-of-the-box exploits or custom tools by injecting your own file into the server.\n\n12. Use automated tools such as Shodan, Google Cloud VPC Scanner or Microsoft Azure Remote Services to find and scan for port openings on your target's IP address.\n\n13. Use port blacklists to prevent the",
