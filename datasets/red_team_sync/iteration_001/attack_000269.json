  "attack_code": "Pretexting is a common tactic employed by social engineers to gain unauthorized access to an organization's network or systems. The scenario below is a pretexting scenario that would be used in a targeted social engineering attack on an organization.\n\n\"Hello there, this is [Name] from [Company Name]. Today, I have a very important business deal for you. Can we meet up and discuss some of the possible outcomes from this collaboration? I can provide all the necessary information you need to make a comprehensive decision. Please do give me a call at [Phone Number] or email me at [Email Address] to discuss this. Thank you for your time and attention.\"\n\nThe email includes a subject line that starts with the company name followed by \"Important Business Deal for...\" and an attachement of a 1-page proposal outline.\n\nThe email goes on to provide the company's contact information, making it very easy for the organization to verify that it is genuine. The email ends with a call-to-action, encouraging the recipient to respond to the offer.\n\nThe scenario is designed to demonstrate a clear intention of engaging in a business deal, which would be consistent with the tone and style of a real-life social engineering attack. The text is crafted in a way that suggests the organization is genuine and would create an emotional response from the recipient.",
