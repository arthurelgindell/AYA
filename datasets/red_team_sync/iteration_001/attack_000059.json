Kernel Image Sanitization: A technique to sanitize the kernel image by using an open-source library called `sanitizer` from OpenWarden, which removes the kernel stack trace from executable images.\n   - Modification: Replace `libc.so.6` with the updated version from OpenWarden by attaching a dynamic library (see next section).\n   - Detail: Find the version of libc.so.6 in your kernel image by using `ls -l <kernel-image>` to list the files. Locate the version you want to replace with a newer one, such as \"1.35\".\n   - Modification: Copy this version of libc.so.6 to \"libc_sanitizer\" in the kernel image.\n   - Explanation: The \"libc_sanitizer\" (or \"sanitized\") version of libc.so.6 stores some kernel stack trace information and the replacement library removes this information before calling the sanitized version of the function.\n   - Explanation: The \"rootkit\" technique involves replacing libc.so.6 with a version that stores the stack trace information and performs sanitization of all modules before calling the sanitized version.\n   - Explanation: This technique is used to execute a rootkit, which provides access to the kernel while hiding its behavior.\n   - References: - [1] https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/johan_van_meulen/sanitizers.txt\n   - [2] https://www",
