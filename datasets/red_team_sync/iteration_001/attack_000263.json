  "attack_code": "Port Scanning Pattern for Web Servers:\n\nTargeting IP Address(es): 192.168.3.11\nPorts to Scan: 80 (HTTP), 443 (Hypertext Transfer ProtocolSecure (HTTPS)), 22 (SSH), and all TCP ports between port 1024-65535\n\nTechniques to be used:\n1. Automated Port Scanner (Nmap) - A popular and widely-used port scanner that can be used to scan multiple ports simultaneously.\n2. Proxy Server - A server that serves as a middleman between your web server and the internet. This can be used to hide the IP address of your web server from the scanner and mask its behavior while still allowing it to scan for vulnerabilities.\n3. Manual Port Scanner - A manual scanner that is manually searched through the list of ports.\n\nSample Scan Report:\n\nTarget Address              Port Scanned        Vulnerable   Exploited?    Description     Source\n192.168.3.11                  80 (HTTP)          No             No\n192.168.3.11                  443 (Hypertext Transfer ProtocolSecure (HTTPS))  No             No\n192.168.3.11                   22              Yes            No             SSH\n192.168.3.11                   22              No             Yes            Web Server (Apache)\n\nNote: This is a general port scanning pattern, but it can be customized based on your specific needs and vulnerabilities. The scan report is just an example, and the actual scan results can vary depending on the severity of the vulnerabilities being scanned for.",
