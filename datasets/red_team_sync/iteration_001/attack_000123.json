{"id": 123, "type": "Buffer overflow exploit", "code": "Let's say we have a buffer overflow vulnerability in our program. We want to create a Buffer Overflow Exploit that exposes the vulnerability in every possible program:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what a Buffer Overflow is and how it works. A buffer overflow occurs when too many bytes of data are read or written to a buffer and the result exceeds its capacity.\n\n2. Once we understand these concepts, we can dive into our program to search for vulnerable areas and exploit them.\n\n3. The exploitation technique is simple: we need to overwrite the value at or before a specific offset in memory with another value.\n\nHere are a few examples of exploits we", "time": "2025-10-10T23:49:59.351673"}
