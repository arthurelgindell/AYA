  "attack_code": "Here's an example SQL injection payload that can be used to exfiltrate data from a table using the `INSERT INTO` and `SELECT * FROM` statements:\n\n```sql\nSET SQL_MODE = \"NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_NULLS\";\nSET time_zone = \"+00:00\";\n\nCREATE TABLE users (\n  id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  email_address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY (id),\n) ;\n```\n\nThe above SQL code creates a table called `users` with three columns - id, name, and email_address. The user table has an auto-incrementing ID column called `id`.\n\nHere's the SQL injection payload we can use to insert data into this table. We assume that your database server name, username and password are correct:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO users (email_address)\nSELECT 'YOUR_EMAIL' FROM DUAL UNION ALL\nSELECT 'YOUR_PASSWORD' FROM DUAL;\n```\n\nReplace `YOUR_EMAIL` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with the values of your choice. The above SQL statement will read data from `DUAL` (your actual database) and insert into the `users` table with email addresses of \"YOUR_EMAIL\" and passwords for YOUR_PASSWORD. The data will be inserted into the table without a password, which makes it an excellent entry point for a SQL injection attack.",
