  "attack_code": "This is a sample SQL statement that can generate time-based blind SQL injection for Oracle database. Keep this in mind as a potential attack vector if you run this SQL statement:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \"MyColumn\" FROM \"my_table\" WHERE date_column >= DATE '2018-07-31' AND date_column < DATE '2019-08-31';\n```\n\nThe `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve results, and the date column (`date_column`) is selected. The date value entered by the user must have a format that is handled by Oracle's `DATE` function.\n\nThe comparison operators (`>`, `<`, and `>=`) are used to select rows based on the date value. The time-based blind SQL injection vector involves performing a SELECT statement that sets up data as follows:\n\n1. The query is run by using the `SELECT` statement that matches the user's input date value.\n2. The database sends a random character string (`CHAR(1)`) to the application for use as a placeholder that will be replaced with the actual date value used in subsequent queries.\n3. The application is instructed to substitute the placeholder into the `SELECT` statement using the `INSERT INTO` statement.\n4. The user-supplied data is replaced by random characters during execution, and the statement is committed with a nonce value (`NVL(TRUNCATE(RANDOM(), '9'), TO_DATE('0001-01-01'))`).\n5. The value is transformed into a fully-qualified, time-based SQL injection vector using the `INSERT INTO` statement.\n6. The values can then be used to perform additional SQL statements which are vulnerable to this same type of attack.\n\nThis is an example of a time-based blind SQL injection that",
