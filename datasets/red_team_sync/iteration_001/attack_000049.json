  "attack_code": "SQL injection is a vulnerability in web applications where attackers can execute SQL commands directly on the database server. To gain unauthorized access via a SQL injection payload in a database, attackers can use the \"insensitive_string\" library or plain text input fields to inject SQL commands.\n\nHere's a sample SQL injection payload for data exfiltration:\n```sql\nDELETE FROM `user` WHERE `username` = '{\"insensitive_string\":\"joe\", \"password\":\"$2a$10$h8zZ3qJTmn7fXwYxZIQ1Ue\"}';\n```\nIn this example, the SQL query includes a payload that looks like plain text in the database. To execute this payload, an attacker would need to have access to the user table in your database.\n\nThe payload would execute the following SQL commands:\n- DELETE from `user` where username = '{\"insensitive_string\":\"joe\", \"password\":\"$2a$10$h8zZ3qJTmn7fXwYxZIQ1Ue\"}'\nThis is a simple payload that can be easily executed by an attacker. It allows them to delete all rows with the username (joe) and password (password$2a$10$h8zZ3qJTmn7fXwYxZIQ1Ue) from the `user` table.\nThis payload can be easily modified to execute a more complex statement or insert statement depending on the specific requirements of the user table.",
