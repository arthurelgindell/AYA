  "attack_code": "TCP SYN flood (also known as packet flooding) is a type of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that involves sending multiple packets or messages to a targeted server in an attempt to overwhelm its resources and force it to shut down. The attacker wants to cause as much delay or latency as possible, making it difficult for legitimate users to access the website or service being targeted. The attacker triggers a SYN flood by sending multiple packets of the same sequence number to a target IP address, which can cause the server's send queue to become overloaded and result in an instance of packet loss.\n\nTo create a TCP SYN flood attack pattern for DDoS, our attacker sends multiple packets of the same sequence number to a targeted server. Let's say the IP address is 192.168.0.1:\n\n- Send Packet 1: SYN, ACK, sequence number (SYN=0, ACK=0)\n- Send Packet 2: SYN, ACK, sequence number (SYN=0, ACK=0)\n- Send Packet 3: SYN, ACK, sequence number (SYN=0, ACK=1)\n- Send Packet 4: SYN, ACK, sequence number (SYN=0, ACK=1)\n- Send Packet 5: SYN, ACK, sequence number (SYN=0, ACK=2)\n- Send Packet 6: SYN, ACK, sequence number (SYN=0, ACK=2)\n- Send Packet 7: SYN, ACK, sequence number (SYN=0, ACK=3)\n- Send Packet 8: SYN, ACK, sequence number (",
