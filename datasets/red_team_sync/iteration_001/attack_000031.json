  "attack_code": "Supply Chain Attack Targeting Software Updates:\n\nIntroduction:\nAttackers are increasingly targeting software updates to exploit vulnerabilities in the software they install. This attack targets the software update process and allows attackers to execute commands, steal sensitive data or delete files that can be used to gain access to other systems and networks.\n\nBackground:\nThe software update process is a vital part of the IT infrastructure of most organizations. It ensures that users receive updates to software applications on a regular basis, fixing bugs and security vulnerabilities. However, this process is also subject to attack. Hackers use techniques such as phishing and malware droppers to lure in unsuspecting employees to deliver their payload.\n\nTarget:\nA supply chain attack targeting software updates can result in thousands of victims. It's a risk-free way to inflict damage on organizations that use software updates. In 2019, attackers used this approach to deliver a highly destructive malware called \"Zebro\" that infected thousands of servers across the US.\n\nApplications:\nThe attackers used a malicious webpage to deliver Zebro. This is just one example of how attackers are targeting software updates. In 2021, cybercriminals launched a mass phishing attack against banks in the US, sending emails to thousands of users with fake software update links. The phishing email was designed to lure victims into downloading malware droppers.\n\nSolution:\nTo mitigate the risks of supply chain attack targeting software updates, organizations need to take the following measures:\n\n1. Implement a strong security posture program. This includes regular testing to identify vulnerabilities, installing the latest antivirus software and patching all critical systems in a timely manner.\n\n2. Use SSL/T",
