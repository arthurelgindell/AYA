{"id": 1207, "type": "Port scan reconnaissance", "code": "Port Scan Reconnaissance: It is a technique used for gathering and analyzing information regarding the security of the target system. In this method, multiple ports are opened on a server to simulate network access attempts from various devices. This process allows the attacker to identify hidden vulnerabilities and to gather information about the security measures being used by the target. Here are a few steps that can be followed to get started with port scan reconnaissance:\n1. Choose a target: Pick an IP address or hostname of a public server that supports port mapping.\n2. Check the security measures: Check the website's website access policies and SSL certificates to see if they are strong enough.\n3. Port mapping:", "time": "2025-10-11T00:06:03.663370"}
