  "attack_code": "SQL Injection Attack on Login Form with Authentication Bypass:\n\nI. Introduction\nA common weakness in web applications is the lack of proper input validation. The user can easily bypass this security measure using SQL injection attacks. In a typical SQL injection attack, the attacker inserts malicious SQL code directly into the client-side browser's request data, instead of relying on input validation.\n\nII. The attack targeted:\nThe login form is one of the most common web applications' authentication methods. However, this type of form has inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited by SQL injection attacks.\n\nIII. Techniques employed:\nThe following SQL injection attack targeted the login form with authentication bypass using two techniques.\n\nIV. Targeted SQL Injection:\n1. SQL injection targeting login form with authentication bypass\nThe attacker inserted a malicious SQL statement into the login form's input fields. The malicious SQL code was specified in the HTML source code of the login form, and it was executed on the client-side browser.\n\n2. SQL injection targeting login form with authentication bypass using injection tags:\nThe attacker inserted the malicious SQL statement into the login form's form element by using a specific injection tag. This approach was adopted to avoid SQL syntax errors and improve the attack's efficiency.\n\nV. How to execute SQL injection attack on login form with authentication bypass:\nThe following are the steps involved in executing a malicious SQL injection attack on login form with authentication bypass:\n1. Load the HTML code of the login form's input field in the browser's source code (e.g., Firebug, Web Developer).\n\n2. Insert a malicious SQL statement into the input field using injection tags:\na. Use the <form> tag to submit HTML forms with POST method and",
