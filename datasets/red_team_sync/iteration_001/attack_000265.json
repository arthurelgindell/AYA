Create a new C# project in Visual Studio 2019 or later.\n2. Open the Binary Expand Tool software and expand a 64-bit binary file.\n3. Save the expanded binary file with an underscore \"_\" at the beginning of its name and extension (such as \"file_0001.exe\").\n4. Open the Memory Profiler software and open the \"Heap\" view in Process Explorer.\n5. Expand the heap view by clicking on \"Expand Heap...\".\n6. Right-click on any unused memory location under the heap view, and select \"Add Process Heap Object\".\n7. Follow the prompts to add memory-mapped objects to the process heap.\n8. Right-click on the \"Process Heap\" object in the Process Explorer, and select \"Properties\".\n9. On the Properties window, find \"Address\" field, and ensure that the \"Max Address\" value is greater than or equal to the size of the memory map object (in this case, 4 bytes is 32 bits and 1 byte is 8 bits).\n\nLet's assume the maximum address value of the memory map object (in this case, 0x9F81A0F0) is already available in the memory map, so we need to add more memory for this object.\n10.
