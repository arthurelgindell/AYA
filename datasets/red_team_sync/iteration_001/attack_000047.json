  "attack_code": "Supply chain attacks have become a major concern in recent times, as cybercriminals are increasingly targeting software systems deployed across the globe. In this scenario example, we will be discussing an attack targeting software updates designed for a popular software application at a major organization.\n\nThe targeted software is a popular enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform that handles financial transactions and other business-related operations. The organization has a strict policy regarding software updates, which must be implemented by developers in specific stages and under their specific guidelines. The supply chain attack aims to manipulate these policies, leading the organization's software updates to bypass verification checks and gain unauthorized access.\n\nThe attack will involve various actors, including cybercriminals, system administrators, and contractors. They will start by disabling the software updates verification process through exploiting a remote-access vulnerability in the organization's network. The cybercriminals will then gain unauthorized access to systems running the ERP software and carry out system manipulation, modifying critical updates.\n\nThe changes impacting the supply chain will be minor and not immediately noticeable, such as minor changes to the updated software versions or slight updates in error codes. The IT team will be notified of the changes, which will likely result in unauthorized access to several critical software updates. However, this move may help the attackers manipulate the security policy of the targeted system, gaining access to the entire organization's software updates.\n\nThe attack will be executed in a thorough manner, targeting several key areas of the ERP software application and compromising various stages during its update cycle. The targeted system is known to use an automated update delivery system, which will be exploited during the attack.\n\nThe supply chain attack aims to gain unauthorized access to several critical software",
