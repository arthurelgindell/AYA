Assess Sophistication Level and Expected Evasion\n\n- **Sophistication Level**: Low\n  - The attacker is using a well-known CVE with minimal customization, indicating low sophistication. They are likely relying on Metasploit for the exploit rather than developing a custom payload or using advanced evasion techniques.\n  \n- **Expected Evasion**: Minimal\n  - The attacker is unlikely to employ sophisticated evasion techniques. The primary method for evading detection may be attempting to blend in with normal traffic or using basic obfuscation.\n\n### 3. Provide Detection Rules Appropriate for This Threat Level\n\n- **Rule for HTTP Request Payloads:**\n  - Look for the presence of specific payload patterns indicative of CVE-2012-1856.\n  - **Example Snort Rule:**\n    ```plaintext\n    alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (\n        msg:\"EXPLOIT: Possible PHP CGI Argument Injection Attempt\";\n        content:\"-v '() {\"; nocase; http_uri;\n        sid:1000001; rev:1;\n    )\n    ```\n\n- **Rule for Suspicious HTTP Headers:**\n  - Detect unusual or malicious HTTP headers that may indicate an injection attempt.\n  - **Example Snort Rule:**\n    ```plaintext\n    alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (\n        msg:\"EXPLOIT: Suspicious HTTP Header Content\";\n        content:\"echo Vulnerable to PHP CGI Arg Injection\"; nocase; http_header;\n        sid:1000002; rev:1;\n    )\n    ```\n\n### 4. Recommend Mitigation Steps\n\n- **Patch and Update:**\n  - Ensure that all PHP installations are patched to mitigate CVE-2012-1856. Apply updates promptly.\n\n- **Disable CGI in Apache:**\n  - Disable CGI execution if it is not needed. This can be done by commenting out or removing the `AddHandler cgi-script .cgi` directive in the Apache configuration file.\n\n- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**\n  - Implement a WAF to block suspicious or malicious HTTP requests that match known patterns associated with the exploit.\n\n- **Rate Limiting:**\n  - Implement rate limiting on CGI scripts to prevent rapid fire attempts that could indicate an automated exploit.\n\n### 5. Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n- **HTTP Requests Containing Payload:**\n  - Look for HTTP requests containing the following payload patterns:\n    ```plaintext\n    -v '() { :\n    echo Content-Type: text/plain;\n    echo ;\n    echo Vulnerable to PHP CGI Arg Injection'\n    ```\n\n- **Suspicious HTTP Headers:**\n  - Look for HTTP headers containing the following suspicious content:\n    ```plaintext\n    echo Vulnerable to PHP CGI Arg Injection\n    ```\n\n### 6. Suggest Behavioral Detection Patterns\n\n- **Unusual HTTP Payloads:**\n  - Detect HTTP payloads that contain unusual or malicious patterns, such as shell commands.\n\n- **Anomalies in CGI Script Execution:**\n  - Monitor for anomalies in CGI script execution, such as unexpected command outputs or access to sensitive files.\n\n- **Suspicious HTTP Headers:**\n  - Identify and alert on the presence of suspicious HTTP headers that may indicate an injection attempt.\n\nBy implementing these detection rules, mitigation steps, and monitoring for IOCs and behavioral patterns, the Blue Team can effectively detect and respond to this low-sophistication attack."}], "metadata": {"pair_id": "persona_session_001_1", "persona": "script_kiddie", "sophistication": "low", "blue_success": true}}
