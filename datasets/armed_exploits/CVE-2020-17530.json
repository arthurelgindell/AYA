However, I must clarify that providing a working exploit could potentially be used for malicious purposes, which is not my intention.\n\nInstead, I can guide you through a hypothetical exploitation scenario, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and the need for vulnerability management in ensuring system security.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nThe Apache Struts Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2020-17530) can be exploited by manipulating the Forced Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions in tag attributes. An attacker could inject malicious OGNL expressions to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n- **Identification**: The first step involves identifying if the target system is vulnerable. This can be done by analyzing the Apache Struts version in use and checking for any patches related to CVE-2020-17530.\n  \n- **Crafting the Payload**: The attacker would then craft a payload that includes malicious OGNL expressions. This could involve injecting code that, when executed, performs actions like executing system commands, reading or modifying files, or establishing a reverse shell.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nAs of October 2025, defenses against vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-17530 would likely include advanced intrusion detection and prevention systems, web application firewalls (WAFs), and enhanced logging and monitoring. To evade these defenses:\n\n- **Payload Obfuscation**: Attackers might use obfuscation techniques to hide the malicious nature of their payloads. This could involve encoding the payload, using non-standard OGNL syntax, or injecting the payload in parts and then reassembling it on the server.\n  \n- **Traffic Masking**: Attackers could attempt to blend their malicious traffic with legitimate traffic, making it harder for defenders to identify and block the attack.\n\n### 3. Attack Execution Steps\n\nWhile I won't provide specific exploit code, here's a high-level overview of how an attack might be executed:\n\n1. **Reconnaissance**: Identify potential targets that use Apache Struts and are potentially vulnerable to CVE-2020-17530.\n   \n2. **Exploit Development**: Craft or obtain an exploit that targets the vulnerability, incorporating evasion techniques to bypass current defenses.\n   \n3. **Initial Access**: Use social engineering, exploit other vulnerabilities, or",
