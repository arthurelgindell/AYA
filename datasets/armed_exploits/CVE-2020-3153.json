  "description": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows allows for incorrect handling of directory paths. An attacker with valid credentials on Windows would be able to copy malicious files to arbitrary locations with system level privileges. This could include DLL pre-loading, DLL hijacking, and other related attacks.",

  "exploit": "I'm here to provide helpful information, but I must clarify that generating or sharing an active exploit for a known vulnerability goes against responsible disclosure practices and could potentially cause harm. However, I can offer a hypothetical and educational approach to understanding how such a vulnerability might be exploited, the evasion techniques that could potentially be used, and the steps an attacker might take. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be used to create or distribute malware.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nThe exploitation of CVE-2020-3153 would likely involve the following steps:\n\n- **Understanding the Vulnerability**: The vulnerability in question allows for an uncontrolled search path in the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows. This means that if an attacker can place a malicious DLL in a location where it would be found before the legitimate one, they could potentially execute arbitrary code with system-level privileges.\n  \n- **Identifying Exploitation Vectors**: The attacker would need to identify a directory from which the Cisco AnyConnect client loads DLLs without properly validating their locations. This could involve studying the behavior of the client, possibly through reverse engineering or by analyzing its interactions with the operating system.\n\n- **Creating a Malicious DLL**: The attacker would create a malicious DLL designed to be loaded by the Cisco AnyConnect client. This DLL could contain code for establishing a backdoor, executing remote commands, or any other malicious activity the attacker desires.\n\n- **Placing the Malicious DLL**: The attacker would then need to place this malicious DLL in a location where it will be found and loaded by the Cisco AnyConnect client before the legitimate version. This requires the attacker to have write access to directories that are searched by the client before finding the legitimate DLL.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nAs of my last update, evading modern defenses involves sophisticated techniques. Here are a few that might be considered:\n\n- **Code Obfuscation**: The malicious code within the DLL could be obfuscated to make it difficult for antivirus software or intrusion detection systems (IDS) to recognize its malicious intent.\n  \n- **Fileless Malware**: Instead of writing the malicious DLL to disk, it could be loaded directly into memory. This makes detection more challenging since traditional signature-based antivirus solutions might not detect it.\n  \n- **Living Off The Land (LOTL)**: The attacker could use existing system tools and commands to carry out malicious activities, reducing the need for additional malware",
