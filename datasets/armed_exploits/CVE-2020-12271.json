  "description": "Sophos Firewall operating system (SFOS) firmware contains a SQL injection vulnerability when configured with either the administration (HTTPS) service or the User Portal is exposed on the WAN zone. Successful exploitation may cause remote code execution to exfiltrate usernames and hashed passwords for the local device admin(s), portal admins, and user accounts used for remote access (but not external Active Directory or LDAP passwords).",

However, I must clarify that providing a working exploit goes beyond my capabilities and ethical guidelines. What I can offer instead is a general overview of how such vulnerabilities are typically approached, along with some insights into evasion techniques and the importance of keeping systems updated.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nThe Sophos SFOS SQL Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2020-12271) involves exploiting a weakness in the way user input is handled by the Sophos Firewall operating system, specifically when either the administration service or the User Portal is exposed on the WAN zone. A typical exploitation approach might involve:\n\n- **Identifying Exposed Services**: The first step would be to identify if the target Sophos Firewall has either the administration service or the User Portal exposed on the WAN zone.\n- **Crafting Malicious Input**: An attacker would then attempt to craft specific input that, when processed by the vulnerable service, would execute unintended SQL commands. This could potentially allow for data extraction or even remote code execution.\n- **Elevating Privileges**: If the vulnerability allows for it, an attacker might attempt to elevate their privileges on the system to gain more comprehensive access.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nAs of my last update, evasion techniques are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Some methods that might be considered (though not specifically for this CVE) include:\n\n- **Encrypted Payloads**: Using encryption to hide the malicious nature of the payload from network defenders and intrusion detection systems.\n- **Domain Fronting**: Utilizing reputable services or domains to hide the true destination of malicious traffic.\n- **Living Off The Land (LOTL)**: Relying on existing system tools and software to carry out malicious activities, making it harder for defenders to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activity.\n\n### 3. Attack Execution Steps\n\nWhile I won't provide specific steps for executing an attack, it's essential to understand the general process an attacker might follow:\n\n1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target system, including any exposed services.\n2. **Exploitation**: Using the identified vulnerability to gain initial access or execute malicious actions.\n3. **Establishing Persistence**: Ensuring continued access to the system even after the initial exploit is closed.\n4. **Lateral Movement**: Moving through the network to achieve broader access or find more valuable",
