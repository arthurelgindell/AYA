However, I must clarify that providing a working exploit or detailed steps for exploitation goes beyond my capabilities due to the sensitive nature of such information. Instead, I can offer a general overview of how vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-23113 might be approached, including exploitation techniques and evasion methods, all within the realm of theoretical discussion and ethical considerations.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nExploiting a format string vulnerability, such as CVE-2024-23113 in Fortinet products, typically involves injecting specially crafted format strings into user-input fields or network requests that are then processed by the vulnerable software. The goal is to manipulate the program's behavior, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or command injection.\n\n- **Identification**: The first step involves identifying the specific vulnerability and understanding how user input is processed by the software. This might involve reviewing source code, if available, or analyzing network traffic to and from the vulnerable system.\n- **Crafting**: The next step is crafting the exploit. This could involve creating a specially formatted string that, when processed by the vulnerable system, would lead to unintended behavior. This might include specifying memory locations or manipulating the stack in a way that allows for code injection.\n- **Delivery**: The crafted exploit would then be delivered to the vulnerable system. This could be through a web interface, network protocol, or any other vector that allows user input to reach the vulnerable software.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nAs of October 2025, defenses against exploits are increasingly sophisticated, including advanced intrusion detection systems (IDS), next-generation firewalls, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. Evasion techniques might include:\n\n- **Encryption**: Encrypting the exploit traffic to avoid detection by signature-based systems.\n- **Obfuscation**: Using various methods to obfuscate the exploit code, making it harder for static analysis tools to detect.\n- **Living Off The Land (LOTL)**: Utilizing existing system tools and commands to carry out malicious activities, reducing the need for detectable foreign code.\n- **Ephemeral Attacks**: Designing attacks that are transient and do not leave persistent malware, making detection and incident response more challenging.\n\n### 3. Attack Execution Steps\n\nThe execution of an attack would generally follow these steps, though the specifics can vary widely:\n\n1. **Reconnaissance**: Gather information about the",
