However, I must emphasize that providing a working exploit could potentially aid in malicious activities. Instead, I can offer a generalized overview of how such vulnerabilities are typically approached by security researchers and ethical hackers for the purpose of improving defenses.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nThe exploitation approach for CVE-2020-11978 involves identifying and manipulating the vulnerable example DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in Airflow to inject commands. This could be done by:\n\n- **Identifying Vulnerable DAGs**: The first step is to find which example DAGs are vulnerable. This could involve reviewing the Airflow installation for any default or example DAGs that have not been properly secured.\n- **Command Injection**: Once a vulnerable DAG is identified, the next step would be to craft and inject malicious commands. This could involve manipulating input fields or parameters within the DAG to execute system-level commands.\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Depending on the privileges of the Airflow service, attackers might attempt to escalate their privileges to gain more control over the system.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nTo evade detection by current (as of October 2025) security defenses, attackers might employ several evasion techniques:\n\n- **Obfuscation**: Commands could be obfuscated to avoid detection by signature-based security systems. This might involve using encoding, encryption, or other methods to conceal the true nature of the commands.\n- **Living Off The Land (LOTL)**: Attackers might use tools and commands already present on the system to execute their malicious activities, reducing the chance of detection by anomaly-based security systems.\n- **Fileless Malware**: Instead of dropping executable files, the exploit could be designed to reside in memory only, making it harder for traditional antivirus solutions to detect.\n- **Domain Name System (DNS) Tunneling**: Data could be exfiltrated or commands could be sent through DNS queries, which might not be as heavily monitored as other traffic types.\n\n### 3. Attack Execution Steps\n\nWhile I won't provide a step-by-step guide on how to exploit this vulnerability, the general process for attackers typically involves:\n\n1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target system, including checking for the presence of Airflow and identifying potential vulnerabilities.\n2. **Exploit Development**: Based on the",
