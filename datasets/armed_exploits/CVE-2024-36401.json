However, I must clarify that providing a working exploit goes beyond my capabilities due to the sensitive nature of such information. I can, though, offer a generalized overview of how one might approach exploiting this kind of vulnerability, along with some insights into evasion techniques and attack execution steps.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nThe OSGeo GeoServer GeoTools Eval Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2024-36401) involves the improper neutralization of directives in dynamically evaluated code. This means an attacker could potentially inject malicious XPath expressions to manipulate the application's behavior, possibly leading to remote code execution (RCE).\n\n- **Initial Assessment**: Understand the GeoServer environment, including its version and any patches applied. This information can help in crafting a more targeted exploit.\n- **Identifying Entry Points**: Determine where user input is evaluated as XPath expressions. This could involve reviewing the application's codebase or using tools to analyze request and response patterns.\n- **Crafting Malicious Input**: Design input that, when evaluated as an XPath expression, could lead to RCE. This might involve escaping or bypassing any input validation mechanisms in place.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nTo evade detection, attackers often employ various techniques:\n\n- **Encryption and Obfuscation**: Encrypting or obfuscating the payload can make it harder for intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to detect the exploit.\n- **Traffic Masking**: Blending malicious traffic with legitimate traffic patterns can help evade network-based detection systems.\n- **Exploit Kit Updates**: Keeping exploit kits updated with the latest evasion techniques and zero-day exploits can increase the chances of success.\n- **Social Engineering**: Sometimes, the easiest way to gain initial access is through social engineering tactics, such as phishing, which can bypass many technical controls.\n\n### 3. Attack Execution Steps\n\n- **Reconnaissance**: Gather information about the target system, including any publicly available details about its setup and version.\n- **Exploit Development**: Based on the vulnerability, develop or obtain an exploit that can inject malicious XPath expressions.\n- **Delivery**: Use various channels (e.g., web application input fields, API endpoints) to deliver the exploit to the target system.\n- **Execution and Privilege Escalation**:",
