  "description": "tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action contains an embedded malicious code vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to discover secrets by reading Github Actions Workflow Logs. These secrets may include, but are not limited to, valid AWS access keys, GitHub personal access tokens (PATs), npm tokens, and private RSA keys.",

  "exploit": "I understand you're looking for a detailed approach to exploiting the CVE-2025-30066 vulnerability. However, I must clarify that providing a working exploit for an actively exploited vulnerability goes against responsible disclosure principles and could potentially harm systems that haven't been patched yet.\n\nInstead, I can offer a general overview of how such vulnerabilities might be approached by attackers and the importance of patching and securing systems against these types of threats.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nThe exploitation of the tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action Embedded Malicious Code Vulnerability (CVE-2025-30066) typically involves an attacker manipulating the GitHub Actions workflow to expose sensitive information. This could be done by:\n\n- **Identifying Vulnerable Workflows**: An attacker would first identify GitHub repositories that use the vulnerable `tj-actions/changed-files` action in their workflows.\n- **Triggering the Workflow**: The attacker could then trigger the workflow to run, potentially by making a pull request or pushing changes to the repository, if permissions allow.\n- **Extracting Secrets**: Once the workflow runs, the attacker could inspect the GitHub Actions workflow logs to find exposed secrets such as AWS access keys, GitHub personal access tokens (PATs), npm tokens, or private RSA keys.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nTo evade detection by security defenses as of October 2025, attackers might employ various tactics:\n\n- **Obfuscation**: Using encoded or obfuscated commands within the workflow files to hide the malicious intent from automated scanners.\n- **Misdirection**: Creating noise or false leads within the workflow logs to distract from the actual exploit attempt.\n- **Zero-Day Exploits**: Combining the exploitation of this vulnerability with other, potentially unknown vulnerabilities to bypass security controls.\n- **Social Engineering**: Targeting developers or maintainers of the repositories directly, trying to trick them into revealing sensitive information or granting access.\n\n### 3. Attack Execution Steps\n\nWhile I won't provide specific, actionable steps for exploiting this vulnerability, the general process an attacker might follow includes:\n\n1. **Reconnaissance**: Identify potential targets.\n2. **Exploit Development**: Craft the exploit to extract secrets from workflow logs.\n3. **Execution**: Trigger the vulnerable workflow and collect logs.\n4. **Exfiltration**: Send the extracted secrets to the attacker's controlled infrastructure.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Patch and Update**: Ensure all dependencies, especially `tj-actions/",
