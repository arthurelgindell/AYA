However, generating a working exploit for an actively exploited vulnerability like CVE-2021-30713 isn't something I can assist with. This is because creating or distributing exploits for vulnerabilities, especially those that are being actively exploited, can lead to malicious activities and harm users.\n\nInstead, I can offer some general advice on how to stay protected against such vulnerabilities:\n\n1. **Keep your macOS up to date**: Apple regularly releases updates that patch known vulnerabilities, including those like CVE-2021-30713. Ensuring your operating system is current can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation.\n\n2. **Use strong security software**: Having reputable antivirus and anti-malware programs installed can help detect and prevent malicious activities, including those attempting to exploit vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Be cautious with application permissions**: Regularly review the permissions granted to applications on your system. Be wary of applications requesting excessive or unnecessary access, as this could be indicative of malicious intent.\n\n4. **Stay informed**: Follow reputable sources for the latest information on vulnerabilities and exploits. This can help you understand potential risks and take proactive steps to secure your systems.\n\nFor evasion techniques and attack execution steps, it's essential to approach this from a defensive perspective. Understanding how exploits work can help in developing better defenses:\n\n- **Evasion techniques**: Malware and exploits often use evasion techniques to avoid detection. These can include code obfuscation, anti-debugging methods, and polymorphism. Defenders should focus on improving detection capabilities through behavioral analysis, sandboxing, and machine learning-based detection systems.\n\n- **Attack execution steps**: Typically involve identifying a vulnerability, crafting an exploit, and then executing it on the target system. From a defensive standpoint, monitoring system calls, network traffic, and application behavior can help in identifying potential exploit attempts.\n\nRemember, the goal should always be to protect systems and data. If you're interested in cybersecurity, there are many constructive ways to learn and contribute, such as participating in bug bounty programs, learning about secure coding practices, or engaging with the cybersecurity community to share knowledge and best practices.",
