However, I can provide general guidance on how vulnerabilities like the one mentioned might be approached by security researchers for defensive purposes.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nExploiting a kernel privilege escalation vulnerability like CVE-2020-17087 typically involves finding a way to manipulate the kernel's data structures or code flow in such a manner that it elevates the attacker's privileges. This could be through:\n\n- **Manipulating Kernel Data Structures:** Finding a way to write or modify sensitive kernel data structures in an unauthorized manner, which could lead to elevated privileges.\n- **Exploiting Use-after-Free or similar bugs:** If there's a way to free kernel memory and then use it, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.\n- **Finding Gadget Chains:** Identifying sequences of code (gadgets) in the kernel that, when executed in a particular order, could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nTo evade current (as of October 2025) defenses, an attacker might employ various techniques, including but not limited to:\n\n- **Code Obfuscation:** Making the exploit code difficult for automated tools and analysts to understand.\n- **Anti-debugging Techniques:** Implementing checks that make it hard for the exploit to be analyzed in a debugging environment.\n- **Memory Protections Bypass:** Finding ways around memory protections like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).\n- **Living Off The Land (LOTL):** Using existing system tools and features to carry out the attack, reducing the need for suspicious custom executables.\n- **Kernel-mode Rootkits:** Some evasion techniques might involve hiding the exploit's existence or effects from the operating system and security tools.\n\n### 3. Attack Execution Steps\n\nWhile I cannot provide specific steps for executing an attack, the general process might look like this:\n\n1. **Initial Foothold:** Gaining access to a vulnerable system.\n2. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the target system, such as its configuration and potential security measures.\n3. **Exploit Development:** Crafting or obtaining an exploit for the specific vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2020-17087).\n4. **Exploit Delivery:** Transferring the exploit to the target system",
