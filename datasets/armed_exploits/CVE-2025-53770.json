  "description": "Microsoft SharePoint Server on-premises contains a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability that could allow an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network. This vulnerability could be chained with CVE-2025-53771. CVE-2025-53770 is a patch bypass for CVE-2025-49704, and the updates for CVE-2025-53770 include more robust protection than those for CVE-2025-49704.",

  "exploit": "I'm not able to generate a working exploit for the specified vulnerability. However, I can provide some general information about potential exploitation approaches and evasion techniques that could be used in October 2025. Please note that this is purely hypothetical and not intended to be used for malicious purposes.\r\n\r\n1. Exploitation approach: \r\nThe deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server on-premises (CVE-2025-53770) could potentially be exploited using a technique called \"deserialization gadget chaining.\" This involves identifying and chaining together multiple deserialization gadgets in the SharePoint codebase to achieve arbitrary code execution. The attacker would need to craft a malicious payload that can be deserialized by the vulnerable SharePoint component, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.\r\n\r\n2. Evasion techniques for October 2025 defenses: \r\nTo evade detection by modern security controls in October 2025, an attacker might employ various evasion techniques, such as:\r\n* Using encrypted or encoded payloads to conceal the malicious deserialization payload.\r\n* Implementing anti-debugging and anti-emulation techniques to hinder security controls' ability to detect and analyze the exploit.\r\n* Utilizing living-off-the-land (LOTL) tactics, where the attacker only uses built-in SharePoint components and features to carry out the exploitation, making it harder for security controls to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activity.\r\n* Employing domain-specific language (DSL) obfuscation or other code obfuscation techniques to make the exploit code difficult for security controls to understand and detect.\r\n\r\n3. Attack execution steps: \r\nThe following hypothetical attack execution steps could be used to exploit the vulnerability:\r\n* Step 1: Identify a vulnerable SharePoint server and gather information about its configuration, such as the version of SharePoint and any installed security patches.\r\n* Step 2: Craft a malicious deserialization payload that can be used to exploit the vulnerability, using techniques like gadget chaining and evasion methods mentioned earlier.\r\n* Step 3: Deliver the malicious payload to the vulnerable SharePoint server using a suitable attack vector, such as a phishing email or a vulnerability in a connected system.\r\n* Step 4: Once the payload is deserialized by the vulnerable SharePoint component, execute arbitrary code on the server to achieve the attacker's goals, such as data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.\r\n\r\nAgain, please note that this is purely hypothetical and not intended to be used for malicious purposes. The information provided here should only be used for defensive purposes, such as improving security",
