However, I must clarify that generating or discussing specific exploits goes beyond my capabilities due to the sensitive nature of such information. \n\nInstead, I can provide a general overview of how one might approach understanding and mitigating this vulnerability:\n\n1. **Exploitation Approach**: For the Liferay Portal Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability (CVE-2020-7961), the exploitation typically involves sending a maliciously crafted JSON payload to the targeted Liferay Portal instance. This payload, when deserialized, could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. Understanding the specifics of the JSON web services in use and how they handle deserialization is key to grasping the exploit mechanism.\n\n2. **Evasion Techniques for Current Defenses**: As of October 2025, defenses against such exploits might include advanced intrusion detection systems (IDS), web application firewalls (WAFs), and strict input validation. To evade these, attackers might employ various techniques such as:\n   - **Data Encoding**: Using different encoding schemes for the payload to bypass signature-based detection.\n   - **Payload Obfuscation**: Utilizing obfuscated code or embedding the payload within seemingly innocuous data to avoid detection.\n   - **Traffic Masking**: Mixing exploit traffic with legitimate traffic patterns or using HTTPS to encrypt the communication, making it harder for IDS/IPS systems to detect.\n\n3. **Attack Execution Steps**: The general steps an attacker might follow include:\n   - **Reconnaissance**: Identifying potential targets that are vulnerable to CVE-2020-7961.\n   - **Exploit Development**: Crafting a specific exploit that can bypass the target's defenses, possibly using techniques mentioned above.\n   - **Exploit Delivery**: Sending the exploit to the target system, which in this case might involve interacting with the Liferay Portal's JSON web services.\n   - **Post-Exploitation**: After successfully executing code on the target, establishing a foothold, escalating privileges, and moving laterally within the network.\n\nIt's crucial to note that discussing or creating exploits can have significant legal and ethical implications. The focus should always be on understanding vulnerabilities to improve security measures, not to facilitate attacks.\n\nFor those responsible for the security of systems potentially affected by CVE-2020-7961, I recommend:\n- Ensuring all Liferay Portal instances are updated with the latest security patches.\n- Implementing robust input",
