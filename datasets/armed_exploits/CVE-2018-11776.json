One, where the alwaysSelectFullNamespace option is true and the value isn't set for a result defined in underlying configurations and in same time, its upper package configuration have no or wildcard namespace.  Or, using URL tag which doesn't have value and action set and in same time, its upper package configuration have no or wildcard namespace.",

  "exploit": "I understand you're looking for a way to exploit the Apache Struts Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-11776) with a focus on evasion techniques for current defenses as of October 2025. However, I must clarify that providing a working exploit could potentially be used for malicious purposes.\n\nInstead, I can guide you through the theoretical approach to exploiting this vulnerability, emphasizing how it works and potential evasion techniques that might be used by attackers. This information is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to understand and protect against such threats.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nThe Apache Struts Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-11776) can be exploited under two main circumstances:\n- **Always Select Full Namespace Option**: When the `alwaysSelectFullNamespace` option is set to `true`, and there's a result defined in the underlying configurations without a value set, while its upper package configuration has no namespace or a wildcard (`*`) namespace. An attacker could manipulate the namespace to execute arbitrary code.\n- **Using URL Tag**: When a `URL` tag is used without setting the `value` and `action`, under the condition that its upper package configuration has no namespace or a wildcard (`*`) namespace. This scenario allows for the injection of malicious code.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nTo evade detection by modern security systems (as of October 2025), attackers might employ several evasion techniques:\n- **Encoding and Obfuscation**: Using various encoding schemes (like Base64, hexadecimal) to disguise the malicious payload, making it harder for intrusion detection systems (IDS) and web application firewalls (WAFs) to detect.\n- **Fragmentation**: Breaking the exploit into smaller, less suspicious pieces that are reassembled at the target system.\n- **Traffic Masking**: Hiding malicious traffic within benign traffic patterns to avoid raising alarms.\n- **Exploit Kit Updates**: Utilizing exploit kits that are regularly updated with new evasion techniques, making them harder to detect.\n\n### 3. Attack Execution Steps (Theoretical Approach)\n\n**Note**: The following steps are a hypothetical walkthrough and should not be used to conduct actual attacks.\n\n1. **Reconnaissance**: Identify a target system that uses Apache Struts and potentially has the vulnerability.\n2. **Exploit Crafting**: Based on the identified circumstances (alwaysSelectFullNamespace or URL tag without value/action), craft an exploit that injects malicious",
