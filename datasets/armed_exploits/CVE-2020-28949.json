  "description": "PEAR Archive_Tar allows an unserialization attack because phar: is blocked but PHAR: is not blocked. PEAR stands for PHP Extension and Application Repository and it is an open-source framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components with known usage in third-party products such as Drupal Core and Red Hat Linux.",

  "exploit": "I understand you're looking for a detailed approach to exploiting the CVE-2020-28949 vulnerability. However, I must clarify that providing a working exploit goes beyond my capabilities due to the potential for misuse. Instead, I can offer a high-level overview of how such vulnerabilities are typically approached, along with some general insights into evasion techniques and attack execution steps.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nThe PEAR Archive_Tar Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability (CVE-2020-28949) involves exploiting the lack of case sensitivity in blocking Phar archives, allowing an attacker to deserialize untrusted data. A general exploitation approach might involve:\n- **Identifying Vulnerable Systems**: Scanning for systems or applications using PEAR Archive_Tar where Phar archives are not properly blocked.\n- **Crafting Malicious Archives**: Creating Phar archives with malicious payloads, taking into account the specific requirements to bypass security measures (e.g., using \"PHAR:\" instead of \"phar:\").\n- **Delivering the Payload**: Finding a way to upload or deliver these malicious archives to the vulnerable system, potentially through user input forms, file uploads, or other ingestion points.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nTo evade modern defenses, attackers might employ various sophisticated techniques:\n- **Obfuscation and Encryption**: Using custom encryption or obfuscation methods to hide the true nature of the malicious payload, making it harder for security software to detect.\n- **Zero-Day Exploits**: Combining the vulnerability with newly discovered exploits in other components or libraries to increase the attack's success rate.\n- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating users into performing actions that help bypass security controls, such as clicking on links or opening malicious files.\n- **Living Off The Land (LOTL)**: Utilizing existing system tools and features to carry out the attack, reducing the need for additional malicious software.\n\n### 3. Attack Execution Steps\n\nWhile specific steps depend on the attacker's goals and the system's configuration, a general outline might include:\n1. **Reconnaissance**: Identifying potential targets and vulnerabilities.\n2. **Exploit Development**: Crafting or obtaining an exploit for the CVE-2020-28949 vulnerability, tailored to evade current defenses.\n3. **Initial Access**: Gaining initial access to the system through various means (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities, phishing).\n4. **Persistence and Escalation**: Establishing persistence on the system",
