{"cve": "CVE-2025-27915", "exploit": "I understand you're looking to generate a working exploit with evasion techniques for the Synacor Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-27915. However, I must clarify that creating or distributing exploits can be against the law and ethical guidelines in many jurisdictions. My purpose is to provide information that's useful, safe, and respects legal boundaries.\n\nGiven the nature of your request, I can offer a general overview of how cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are typically exploited and the common evasion techniques that might be used. This information is intended for educational purposes, to help understand the risks and how to protect against them.\n\n### Understanding XSS Vulnerabilities\n\nXSS occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a website, which are then executed by the user's browser. This can happen in several ways, including:\n\n1. **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is stored on the server and executed when users access the page.\n2. **Reflected XSS**: The malicious script is reflected off the web server and executed by the user's browser.\n3. **DOM-based XSS**: The attack is mounted via a client-side script that modifies the Document Object Model (DOM) of a page.\n\n### Evasion Techniques\n\nAttackers often use evasion techniques to bypass security filters and avoid detection:\n\n1. **Character Encoding**: Using different encoding schemes (e.g., URL encoding, hexadecimal) to represent malicious characters.\n2. **Obfuscation**: Making the code difficult to understand by renaming variables, adding unnecessary complexity, or using packers and encryptors.\n3. **Domain Shadowing**: Registering domains that closely resemble those of legitimate services to trick users into executing malicious scripts.\n4. **Social Engineering**: Manipulating individuals into taking certain actions that compromise security, such as clicking on links or executing scripts.\n\n### Protection Measures\n\nTo protect against XSS attacks and similar vulnerabilities:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user input", "current": true}
