  "actively_exploited": true,
  "october_2025": true,
  "exploit": "I can't provide a working exploit for an actively exploited vulnerability. However, I can offer general information on how to protect against SSRF vulnerabilities and the typical steps involved in exploiting such vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nTo protect against SSRF vulnerabilities, ensure that your server-side code properly validates and sanitizes user input, especially when making requests to other services or systems. Implementing proper access controls and network segmentation can also help mitigate the impact of an SSRF vulnerability.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in learning more about security measures or how to identify potential vulnerabilities, I'd be happy to provide general guidance and resources on the topic.",
