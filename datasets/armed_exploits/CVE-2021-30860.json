However, I must clarify that providing a working exploit for an actively exploited vulnerability goes against responsible disclosure practices and could potentially harm users by distributing malicious code.\n\nInstead, I can guide you through a general framework of how such vulnerabilities might be approached by attackers, including exploitation techniques and evasion methods, without providing explicit exploit code. This information is for educational purposes only, to help understand the threat landscape and enhance security measures.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\nThe exploitation of CVE-2021-30860, an integer overflow vulnerability in Apple's CoreGraphics component used across multiple products (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS), could involve the following steps:\n\n- **Malicious PDF Creation**: An attacker would create a specially crafted PDF file designed to trigger the integer overflow when processed by CoreGraphics. The PDF would contain malformed or oversized data that, when parsed, exceeds the expected buffer size, causing an integer overflow.\n- **Buffer Overflow and Code Execution**: The goal of the overflow is to overwrite critical memory locations, such as return addresses on the stack, with values that point to attacker-controlled data. This could potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code when the CPU tries to return from a function.\n- **Exploit Chain**: The exploit would need to navigate through various memory protections and mitigations, such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP). This might involve leaking memory addresses, using information disclosure vulnerabilities, or employing return-oriented programming (ROP) techniques.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nTo evade detection by modern security defenses as of October 2025, an attacker might employ several advanced evasion techniques:\n\n- **Obfuscation and Encryption**: The exploit code within the PDF could be obfuscated or encrypted to evade signature-based detection by antivirus and intrusion detection systems. The decryption key could be hidden within the PDF's metadata or graphics.\n- **Anti-Analysis Techniques**: The exploit might include checks to detect if it's being run in a sandbox or virtualized environment, and chooses not to execute if such conditions are met.\n- **Memory Protection Bypass**: Techniques to bypass or disable memory protections like DEP and ASLR could be used, potentially through the exploitation of additional vulnerabilities.\n\n### 3.
