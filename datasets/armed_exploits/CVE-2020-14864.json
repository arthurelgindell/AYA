However, I must clarify that providing a working exploit for an actively exploited vulnerability goes beyond my capabilities due to ethical and security concerns. \n\nInstead, I can offer a generalized approach on how such vulnerabilities are typically exploited, along with some common evasion techniques and attack execution steps that might be relevant as of my last update in 2023. Please note, the specifics can vary greatly depending on the environment and the current state of security measures.\n\n### 1. Exploitation Approach\n\n- **Path Traversal:** The exploitation of a path traversal vulnerability involves manipulating the file path input to access files outside the intended directory. In the case of CVE-2020-14864, an attacker would target the `previewFilePath` parameter of the `getPreviewImage` function to potentially access arbitrary system files.\n- **Information Gathering:** Before exploitation, attackers often gather information about the target environment, including the operating system, software versions, and potential security measures in place.\n- **Payload Construction:** The attacker constructs a malicious payload that exploits the path traversal vulnerability. This could involve crafting a specific file path that, when traversed, leads to sensitive system files or files that can be used to escalate privileges.\n\n### 2. Evasion Techniques for October 2025 Defenses\n\nAs of my last update, evasion techniques continue to evolve. Some common strategies include:\n\n- **Obfuscation:** Using encoding or encryption to hide the true nature of the payload from detection tools.\n- **Fragmentation:** Breaking up the exploit into smaller, less suspicious pieces that are reassembled at the target.\n- **Living Off The Land (LOTL):** Utilizing existing system tools and commands to carry out malicious activities, making the attack blend in with normal system activity.\n- **Anti-Analysis Techniques:** Incorporating checks to detect and evade sandbox environments, debuggers, or other analysis tools.\n\n### 3. Attack Execution Steps\n\n1. **Reconnaissance:** Gather information about the target system, including potential vulnerabilities and security software in use.\n2. **Exploit Deployment:** Deliver the exploit to the target system, potentially using social engineering, exploited vulnerabilities in other software, or direct attacks on vulnerable services.\n3. **Exploitation:** Activate the exploit, manipulate the `previewFilePath` parameter to access sensitive files or escalate privileges.\n4. **Establish Persistence:**",
